In 1997, Hanna-Barbera consolidated its operations with\\nWarner Bros. Animation\\n,\\n[\\n1\\n]\\nmoving into their facilities in 1998, where Cartoon Network Studios also operated briefly. Hanna-Barbera closed permanently in 2001, and Warner Bros. Animation has managed its intellectual property to this day, occasionally using the Hanna-Barbera brand as a label.\\nIn 1999, Cartoon Network acquired a large building in\\nBurbank, California\\n, to serve as the headquarters for Cartoon Network Studios after its effective separation from Hanna-Barbera and Warner Bros. Animation. This was due to the need for Cartoon Network Studios to become an independent entity dedicated to creating original series, while Warner Bros. Animation focused on existing IPs. The studio opened on May 22, 2000, and operated in those facilities for over 20 years.\\nIn the 2020s, after multiple corporate mergers, the studio was consolidated into Warner Bros. Animation, and continued to operate as a separate division, although it was relocated to Second Century Development as the company's new headquarters on August 1, 2023.\\nSam Register\\n, the president of both studios in Burbank, California, also leads\\nHanna-Barbera Studios Europe\\n(formerly Cartoon Network Studios Europe) in\\nLondon, England\\n, alongside Vanessa Brookman.\\n[\\n2\\n]\\nHistory\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\n1990s\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nIn the 20th century, animation as a medium became popular on television.\\nHanna-Barbera\\nbecame the premier studio for small-screen animated programs, launching a dominant series of\\nSaturday-morning\\nfare, including\\nScooby-Doo\\n,\\nThe Flintstones\\n,\\nThe Jetsons\\n, and more.\\n[\\n3\\n]\\nBy the 1980s,\\ncable television\\nwas developed,\\n[\\n4\\n]\\nwith businessman\\nTed Turner\\none of its pioneers.\\n[\\n5\\n]\\nTurner founded several cable channels and also acquired vast film libraries, and in 1991,\\nhis company\\nsigned a joint deal to buy Hanna-Barbera.\\n[\\n6\\n]\\nThe Cartoon Network was developed as a cable outlet to air these animated properties, which largely consisted of H-B\\nreruns\\n.\\n[\\n7\\n]\\nAs the channel grew in subscribers, executives at the\\nAtlanta\\n-based company sought out original programming to supplement its catalog. Other animation-heavy cable channels, including\\nNickelodeon\\nand\\nDisney Channel\\n, respectively founded\\nGames Animation\\nand\\nWalt Disney Television Animation\\nas internal divisions to develop original programming.\\n[\\n8\\n]\\n[\\n9\\n]\\nThe network's first attempt at original content was\\nSpace Ghost Coast to Coast\\n, with the division of Cartoon Network in charge switching to production of adult-focused programming as\\nWilliams Street\\n.\\n[\\n10\\n]\\nCartoon Network Studios originated in 1994 as a division of Hanna-Barbera that focused on producing original programming suitable for children for the network. Hanna-Barbera had been located on\\nCahuenga Boulevard\\nin\\nLos Angeles\\nsince 1963, and housed the studio, its archives, and its extensive animation art collection.\\n[\\n11\\n]\\nIts first productions included\\nWhat a Cartoon!\\n(1995), an anthology series of short subjects serving as pilots for new CN programs. The first of these,\\nDexter's Laboratory\\n, launched in 1996 and was an immediate success, with creator\\nGenndy Tartakovsky\\nbecoming a longtime associate of the company. The same year,\\nTurner Broadcasting System\\nwas merged with\\nTime Warner\\n, and Hanna-Barbera closed its Cahuenga campus, relocating to\\nSherman Oaks Galleria\\nin nearby\\nSherman Oaks\\n, where\\nWarner Bros. Animation\\nwas located.\\n[\\n12\\n]\\nOver the course of this transition, the Cartoon Network Studios branding was briefly phased out, with newer programs, including\\nJohnny Bravo\\n(1997) and\\nThe Powerpuff Girls\\n(1998).\\n2000s\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nOn July 21, 1999, Cartoon Network officially started the studio to separate itself from the complete folding of Hanna-Barbera into WBA. Following the death of the studio's co-founder\\nWilliam Hanna\\nin 2001, Cartoon Network Studios took over the animation function of\\nHanna-Barbera\\n.\\n[\\n13\\n]\\nThe network acquired a three-story 43,000-square-foot facility located at 300 N 3rd St. in\\nBurbank, California\\nto house its new offices, previously a commercial bakery, and prior to that, the location of a\\nPacific Bell\\ntelephone exchange.\\n[\\n14\\n]\\n[\\n15\\n]\\nAccording to Cartoon Brew, the network spent around $1.2 million to renovate the building.\\n[\\n16\\n]\\nThe network took counsel from its top cartoonists,\\nGenndy Tartakovsky\\nand\\nCraig McCracken\\n, on the site of its new studio, as well as design proposals for its offices.\\n[\\n17\\n]\\nIn March 2000, the network began to transfer its production offices, and on May 22, 2000, the studio was christened by veteran animator and animation advisor\\nJoseph Barbera\\nwith a bottle of champagne.\\n[\\n18\\n]\\nThe building's official opening came on August 24, 2000; former\\nDiC\\nand\\nNickelodeon\\nemployees\\nBrian A.

In 2001, Lazzo called the studio \\\"the\\nTermite Terrace\\nof today.\\\"\\n[\\n23\\n]\\nLogo used from 2001 to 2012\\nIn 2002, the studio produced two television pilots for Adult Swim,\\nWelcome to Eltingville\\nand\\nThe Groovenians\\n, none of which were picked as a full series.\\n[\\n24\\n]\\n[\\n25\\n]\\nAlso, the studio released this year its only theatrical film to date:\\nThe Powerpuff Girls Movie\\n, based on\\nThe Powerpuff Girls\\n, which received positive reviews from critics\\n[\\n26\\n]\\nbut was a commercial failure for\\nWarner Bros. Pictures\\nat the box office. In 2006, CNS collaborated with sister studio\\nWilliams Street\\nfor the first time for\\nKorgoth of Barbaria\\n, a television pilot made for Adult Swim, which was also not green-lit as a series.\\n[\\n27\\n]\\nIn 2007, CNS began its first foray into\\nlive-action\\nwith the hybrid series\\nOut of Jimmy's Head\\n, and then its first fully live-action project,\\nBen 10: Race Against Time\\nand its sequel,\\nBen 10: Alien Swarm\\n, along with the television pilots\\nLocker 514\\n,\\nSiblings\\nand\\nStan the Man\\n.

Former\\nNew Line Television\\nproducer Mark Costa was hired to oversee the projects and CNS' live-action production company Alive and Kicking, Inc..\\nIncredible Crew\\nwas the last series in that genre the studio produced for Cartoon Network. Despite the failure of live-action on the channel, the studio's infrastructure was retained to produce live-action fare for sibling programming block Adult Swim, identifying on-air as Alive and Kicking, along with two other companies (Rent Now Productions and Factual Productions), instead of using the Cartoon Network Studios banner.\\n2010s\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nLogo used from 2010 to 2015\\nOn April 5, 2010,\\nAdventure Time\\npremiered on Cartoon Network; the same series began life as\\na short\\nfeatured on\\nNicktoons\\n'\\nRandom!

Other animation-heavy cable channels, including\\\\nNickelodeon\\\\nand\\\\nDisney Channel\\\\n, respectively founded\\\\nGames Animation\\\\nand\\\\nWalt Disney Television Animation\\\\nas internal divisions to develop original programming.\\\\n[\\\\n8\\\\n]\\\\n[\\\\n9\\\\n]\\\\nThe network\\'s first attempt at original content was\\\\nSpace Ghost Coast to Coast\\\\n, with the division of Cartoon Network in charge switching to production of adult-focused programming as\\\\nWilliams Street\\\\n.\\\\n[\\\\n10\\\\n]\\\\nCartoon Network Studios originated in 1994 as a division of Hanna-Barbera that focused on producing original programming suitable for children for the network.

The first of these,\\\\nDexter\\'s Laboratory\\\\n, launched in 1996 and was an immediate success, with creator\\\\nGenndy Tartakovsky\\\\nbecoming a longtime associate of the company. The same year,\\\\nTurner Broadcasting System\\\\nwas merged with\\\\nTime Warner\\\\n, and Hanna-Barbera closed its Cahuenga campus, relocating to\\\\nSherman Oaks Galleria\\\\nin nearby\\\\nSherman Oaks\\\\n, where\\\\nWarner Bros. Animation\\\\nwas located.\\\\n[\\\\n12\\\\n]\\\\nOver the course of this transition, the Cartoon Network Studios branding was briefly phased out, with newer programs, including\\\\nJohnny Bravo\\\\n(1997) and\\\\nThe Powerpuff Girls\\\\n(1998).\\\\n2000s\\\\n[\\\\nedit\\\\n]\\\\nOn July 21, 1999, Cartoon Network officially started the studio to separate itself from the complete folding of Hanna-Barbera into WBA. Following the death of the studio\\'s co-founder\\\\nWilliam Hanna\\\\nin 2001, Cartoon Network Studios took over the animation function of\\\\nHanna-Barbera\\\\n.\\\\n[\\\\n13\\\\n]\\\\nThe network acquired a three-story 43,000-square-foot facility located at 300 N 3rd St. in\\\\nBurbank, California\\\\nto house its new offices, previously a commercial bakery, and prior to that, the location of a\\\\nPacific Bell\\\\ntelephone exchange.\\\\n[\\\\n14\\\\n]\\\\n[\\\\n15\\\\n]\\\\nAccording to Cartoon Brew, the network spent around $1.2 million to renovate the building.\\\\n[\\\\n16\\\\n]\\\\nThe network took counsel from its top cartoonists,\\\\nGenndy Tartakovsky\\\\nand\\\\nCraig McCracken\\\\n, on the site of its new studio, as well as design proposals for its offices.\\\\n[\\\\n17\\\\n]\\\\nIn March 2000, the network began to transfer its production offices, and on May 22, 2000, the studio was christened by veteran animator and animation advisor\\\\nJoseph Barbera\\\\nwith a bottle of champagne.\\\\n[\\\\n18\\\\n]\\\\nThe building\\'s official opening came on August 24, 2000; former\\\\nDiC\\\\nand\\\\nNickelodeon\\\\nemployees\\\\nBrian A.

She revealed in a post-match interview that the coordinates (\\\\n26 28 0.75\\\\\" N 80 5\\' 1.4\\\\\" W)\\\\npointed to public tennis courts in\\\\nDelray Beach\\\\nwhere she grew up and trained.\\\\n[\\\\n158\\\\n]\\\\nIn 2025, Gauff became the face of a collaboration between\\\\nMiu Miu\\\\nand New Balance, blending luxury fashion with performance wear in a campaign that highlighted her crossover appeal.\\\\n[\\\\n159\\\\n]\\\\nPersonal life\\\\n[\\\\nedit\\\\n]\\\\nGauff in 2022\\\\nGauff is a\\\\nChristian\\\\n. Since she was eight years old, she has prayed with her father before every match that she and her opponent would be safe. After winning the Cincinnati Open in August 2023, she said: \\\\\"... I\\'d like to thank my Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. I spent a lot of nights alone, crying trying to figure it out. I still have a lot to figure out, but I thank Him for covering me.\\\\\" After winning her first major title in September 2023, she said: \\\\\"... I don\\'t pray for results, I just ask that I get the strength to give it my all and whatever happens happens. I\\'m so blessed in this life.\\\\\"\\\\n[\\\\n160\\\\n]\\\\nGauff\\'s tennis idols are Serena and Venus Williams. \\\\\"Serena Williams has always been my idol...and Venus,\\\\\" she has said. \\\\\"They are the reason why I wanted to pick up a tennis racquet.\\\\\"\\\\n[\\\\n16\\\\n]\\\\nGauff first met Serena when she won the Little Mo national tournament at the age of eight, and later met her again to film a commercial for\\\\nDelta Air Lines\\\\nand at the Mouratoglou Academy.\\\\n[\\\\n13\\\\n]\\\\nAfter defeating Venus Williams at Wimbledon in 2019, Gauff expressed her respect when they shook hands at the net. \\\\\"I was just telling her thank you for everything she\\'s done for the sport,\\\\\" Gauff said. \\\\\"She\\'s been an inspiration for many people. I was just really telling her thank you.\\\\\"\\\\n[\\\\n38\\\\n]\\\\nGauff stated in 2020 that she had experienced\\\\ndepression\\\\nand stress related to her sporting career, though her parents clarified that she was not diagnosed with depression in the clinical sense, and had not sought medical attention relating to her psychological well-being.\\\\n[\\\\n161\\\\n]\\\\nGauff is a fan of\\\\nanime\\\\n, including\\\\nMy Hero Academia\\\\n.\\\\n[\\\\n162\\\\n]\\\\nGauff is a huge fan of popular YouTubers and streamers\\\\nLudwig Ahgren\\\\n, Valkyrae & Kai Cenat.\\\\n[\\\\n163\\\\n]\\\\nIn July 2023, Gauff and actress\\\\nStorm Reid\\\\nhelped fund a new playground and purple-painted tennis courts in East Atlanta\\'s\\\\nBrownwood Park\\\\n.\\\\n[\\\\n164\\\\n]\\\\nCareer statistics\\\\n[\\\\nedit\\\\n]\\\\nMain article:\\\\nCoco Gauff career statistics\\\\nGrand Slam tournament performance timelines\\\\n[\\\\nedit\\\\n]\\\\nKey\\\\nW\\\\nF\\\\nSF\\\\nQF\\\\n#R\\\\nRR\\\\nQ#\\\\nDNQ\\\\nA\\\\nNH\\\\n(W) winner; (F) finalist; (SF) semifinalist; (QF) quarterfinalist; (#R) rounds 4, 3, 2, 1; (RR) round-robin stage; (Q#) qualification round; (DNQ) did not qualify; (A) absent;  (NH) not held; (SR) strike rate (events won / competed); (W\\\\u2013L) win\\\\u2013loss record.\\\\nTo avoid confusion and double counting, these charts are updated at the conclusion of a tournament or when the player\\'s participation has ended.\\\\nSingles\\\\n[\\\\nedit\\\\n]\\\\nTournament\\\\n2019\\\\n2020\\\\n2021\\\\n2022\\\\n2023\\\\n2024\\\\n2025\\\\nSR\\\\nW\\\\u2013L\\\\nWin\\\\u00a0%\\\\nAustralian Open\\\\nA\\\\n4R\\\\n2R\\\\n1R\\\\n4R\\\\nSF\\\\nQF\\\\n0 / 6\\\\n16\\\\u20136\\\\n73%\\\\nFrench Open\\\\nQ2\\\\n2R\\\\nQF\\\\nF\\\\nQF\\\\nSF\\\\nW\\\\n1 / 6\\\\n27\\\\u20135\\\\n84%\\\\nWimbledon\\\\n4R\\\\nNH\\\\n4R\\\\n3R\\\\n1R\\\\n4R\\\\n1R\\\\n0 / 6\\\\n11\\\\u20136\\\\n65%\\\\nUS Open\\\\n3R\\\\n1R\\\\n2R\\\\nQF\\\\nW\\\\n4R\\\\n4R\\\\n1 / 7\\\\n20\\\\u20136\\\\n77%\\\\nWin\\\\u2013loss\\\\n5\\\\u20132\\\\n4\\\\u20133\\\\n9\\\\u20134\\\\n12\\\\u20134\\\\n14\\\\u20133\\\\n16\\\\u20134\\\\n14\\\\u20133\\\\n2 / 25\\\\n74\\\\u201323\\\\n76%\\\\nDoubles\\\\n[\\\\nedit\\\\n]\\\\nTournament\\\\n2019\\\\n2020\\\\n2021\\\\n2022\\\\n2023\\\\n2024\\\\n2025\\\\nSR\\\\nW\\\\u2013L\\\\nWin\\\\u00a0%\\\\nAustralian Open\\\\nA\\\\nQF\\\\nQF\\\\n1R\\\\nSF\\\\nA\\\\nA\\\\n0 / 4\\\\n10\\\\u20134\\\\n71%\\\\nFrench Open\\\\n1R\\\\n3R\\\\n1R\\\\nF\\\\nSF\\\\nW\\\\nA\\\\n1 / 6\\\\n17\\\\u20135\\\\n77%\\\\nWimbledon\\\\nA\\\\nNH\\\\n3R\\\\nA\\\\n3R\\\\nQF\\\\nA\\\\n0 / 3\\\\n7\\\\u20133\\\\n70%\\\\nUS Open\\\\n3R\\\\n2R\\\\nF\\\\n1R\\\\nQF\\\\nA\\\\n0 / 5\\\\n11\\\\u20135\\\\n69%\\\\nWin\\\\u2013loss\\\\n2\\\\u20132\\\\n6\\\\u20133\\\\n10\\\\u20134\\\\n5\\\\u20133\\\\n13\\\\u20134\\\\n9\\\\u20131\\\\n0\\\\u20130\\\\n1 / 18\\\\n45\\\\u201317\\\\n73%\\\\nGrand Slam tournaments\\\\n[\\\\nedit\\\\n]\\\\nSingles: 3 (2 titles, 1 runner-up)\\\\n[\\\\nedit\\\\n]\\\\nResult\\\\nYear\\\\nTournament\\\\nSurface\\\\nOpponent\\\\nScore\\\\nLoss\\\\n2022\\\\nFrench Open\\\\nClay\\\\nIga \\\\u015awi\\\\u0105tek\\\\n1\\\\u20136, 3\\\\u20136\\\\nWin\\\\n2023\\\\nUS Open\\\\nHard\\\\nAryna Sabalenka\\\\n2\\\\u20136, 6\\\\u20133, 6\\\\u20132\\\\nWin\\\\n2025\\\\nFrench Open\\\\nClay\\\\nAryna Sabalenka\\\\n6\\\\u20137\\\\n(5\\\\u20137)\\\\n, 6\\\\u20132, 6\\\\u20134\\\\nDoubles: 3 (1 title, 2 runner-ups)\\\\n[\\\\nedit\\\\n]\\\\nResult\\\\nYear\\\\nTournament\\\\nSurface\\\\nPartner\\\\nOpponents\\\\nScore\\\\nLoss\\\\n2021\\\\nUS Open\\\\nHard\\\\nCaty McNally\\\\nSamantha Stosur\\\\nZhang Shuai\\\\n3\\\\u20136, 6\\\\u20133, 3\\\\u20136\\\\nLoss\\\\n2022\\\\nFrench Open\\\\nClay\\\\nJessica Pegula\\\\nCaroline Garcia\\\\nKristina Mladenovic\\\\n6\\\\u20132, 3\\\\u20136, 2\\\\u20136\\\\nWin\\\\n2024\\\\nFrench Open\\\\nClay\\\\nKate\\\\u0159ina Siniakov\\\\u00e1\\\\nSara Errani\\\\nJasmine Paolini\\\\n7\\\\u20136\\\\n(7\\\\u20135)\\\\n, 6\\\\u20133\\\\nYear-end championships (WTA Finals)\\\\n[\\\\nedit\\\\n]\\\\nSingles: 1 (title)\\\\n[\\\\nedit\\\\n]\\\\nResult\\\\nYear\\\\nTournament\\\\nSurface\\\\nOpponent\\\\nScore\\\\nWin\\\\n2024\\\\nWTA Finals\\\\n, Saudi Arabia\\\\nHard (i)\\\\nZheng Qinwen\\\\n3\\\\u20136, 6\\\\u20134, 7\\\\u20136\\\\n(7\\\\u20132)\\\\nReferences\\\\n[\\\\nedit\\\\n]\\\\n^\\\\n\\\\\"Career Prize Money Leaders\\\\\"\\\\n(PDF)\\\\n.\\\\nArchived\\\\n(PDF)\\\\nfrom the original on February 26, 2020\\\\n.

His campaign platform when running was the establishment of a technological college. As a state representative in 1882, Harris introduced the bill to establish the\\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\\n(originally called the Georgia School of Technology until assuming its current name in 1948).\\n[\\n7\\n]\\nThat bill was approved by the\\nGeorgia General Assembly\\non October 13, 1885, after failing to pass through the legislature in 1883 and again in 1884.  Harris received public support in this matter from\\nHenry W. Grady\\nand\\nJohn Fletcher Hanson\\n.\\nThe bill called for Governor\\nHenry Dickerson McDaniel\\nto appoint a five-member commission to select the location of the new school and organize it. Harris was named to that group as chairman alongside\\nSamuel N. Inman\\nfrom Atlanta as the treasurer,\\nOliver S. Porter\\nfrom\\nNewnan, Georgia\\n,\\nEdward R. Hodgson Sr.\\nfrom Athens, and Judge\\nColumbus Heard\\nfrom\\nGreene County, Georgia\\n.\\nMeeting in Atlanta on October 19, 1886, the committee took 23 separate ballots amongst themselves before selecting\\nAtlanta\\nfor the school's location over Macon, Milledgeville, Athens and\\nPenfield\\n. Harris, Hodgson and Inman voted for their cities of residence on every ballot with Porter and Heard voting for Atlanta on the last ballot to give that city a majority. Harris was named the president of the school's Board of Trustees, and he served in that position the rest of his life.\\nElected to the\\nGeorgia Senate\\nfrom 1894 to 1895, Harris then served as judge of the Superior Court of the Macon Circuit from 1912 until his resignation in 1915 to successfully run for\\nGovernor of Georgia\\n. He was sworn in on June 26, 1915, and served until 1917 being the last governor of Georgia born outside the state of Georgia. During his tenure, Harris was noted for signing\\nProhibition\\ninto state law. He returned to his Macon law practice after his gubernatorial term and served as Pension Commissioner of Georgia from 1924 to 1925 in addition to being president of the Electoral College of Georgia.\\nHarris was a first cousin of\\nAlfred Alexander Taylor\\nand\\nRobert Love Taylor\\n, both of whom were\\nUnited States Congressmen\\nfrom, and Governors of, Tennessee.\\nDeath\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nHarris died at his summer home in\\nHampton, Tennessee\\non September 21, 1929\\n[\\n4\\n]\\nand was buried in\\nRose Hill Cemetery\\nin Macon.\\nSee also\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nHistory of Georgia Tech\\nReferences\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\n^\\nNational Governors Association\\n^\\na\\nb\\n\\\"Tennessean, Once Georgia Executive, Tech Founder, Dies\\\"\\n.\\nThe Tennessean\\n. p.\\u00a02\\n.

His campaign platform when running was the establishment of a technological college. As a state representative in 1882, Harris introduced the bill to establish the\\\\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\\\\n(originally called the Georgia School of Technology until assuming its current name in 1948).\\\\n[\\\\n7\\\\n]\\\\nThat bill was approved by the\\\\nGeorgia General Assembly\\\\non October 13, 1885, after failing to pass through the legislature in 1883 and again in 1884.  Harris received public support in this matter from\\\\nHenry W.

Harris, Hodgson and Inman voted for their cities of residence on every ballot with Porter and Heard voting for Atlanta on the last ballot to give that city a majority.

He was sworn in on June 26, 1915, and served until 1917 being the last governor of Georgia born outside the state of Georgia.

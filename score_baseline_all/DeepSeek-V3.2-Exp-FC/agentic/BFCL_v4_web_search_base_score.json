In order to receive foreign donations, BRAC was subsequently registered under the\\nNGO Affairs Bureau of the Government of Bangladesh\\n. BRAC is the largest\\nnon-governmental development organisation\\nin the world, in terms of the number of employees, as of September 2016.\\n[\\n3\\n]\\n[\\n4\\n]\\n[\\n5\\n]\\nFounded by\\nSir Fazle Hasan Abed\\nin 1972, shortly after the\\nindependence of Bangladesh\\n, BRAC now operates in all 64\\ndistricts of Bangladesh\\nand in 16 other countries across Asia, Africa, and the Americas.\\n[\\n6\\n]\\nBRAC states that it employs over 90,000 people, roughly 70 percent of whom are women, and that it reaches more than 126 million people with its services.\\n[\\n7\\n]\\n[\\n8\\n]\\n[\\n9\\n]\\nBRAC has operations in 12 countries.\\n[\\n7\\n]\\n[\\n10\\n]\\nHistory\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nSir Fazle Hasan Abed\\n, founder of BRAC\\nKnown formerly as the Bangladesh Rehabilitation Assistance Committee, then as the Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee, and later as Building Resources Across Communities,\\n[\\n11\\n]\\nBRAC was initiated in 1972 by\\nSir Fazle Hasan Abed\\nat\\nShallah Upazillah\\nin the district of\\nSunamganj\\nas a large scale relief and rehabilitation project to help returning war refugees after the\\nBangladesh Liberation War\\nof 1971.\\n[\\n12\\n]\\nUntil the mid-1970s, BRAC concentrated on community development through village development programmes that included agriculture, fisheries,\\ncooperatives\\n, rural crafts,\\nadult literacy\\n, health and family planning, vocational training for women, and the construction of community centres. A Research and Evaluation Division (RED) was set up to evaluate its activities and decide direction, and in 1977, BRAC began taking a more targeted approach by creating Village Organisations (VO) to assist the landless, small farmers, artisans, and vulnerable women. That same year, BRAC set up a commercial printing press to help finance its activities. The handicraft retail chain called\\nAarong\\nwas established the following year.\\n[\\n13\\n]\\nIn the late 1970s,\\ndiarrhoea\\nwas a leading cause of\\nchild mortality\\nin Bangladesh.\\n[\\n14\\n]\\nIn February 1979, BRAC began a field trial in two villages of what was then\\nSulla thana\\n, of a campaign to combat diarrhoea.\\n[\\n15\\n]\\nThe following year, they scaled up the operation and named it the Oral Therapy Extension Programme (OTEP).\\n[\\n16\\n]\\nIt taught rural mothers in their homes how to prepare an\\noral rehydration solution\\n(ORS) from readily available ingredients and how to use it to treat diarrhoea.\\n[\\n17\\n]\\nThe training was reinforced with posters and radio and TV spots.\\n[\\n18\\n]\\nThe ten-year programme taught 12 million households spread over 75,000 villages in every part of Bangladesh except the Chittagong Hill Tracts (which were unsafe to work in because of civil unrest).\\n[\\n19\\n]\\nFifteen years after they were taught, the vast majority of mothers could still prepare a safe and effective ORS.\\n[\\n20\\n]\\nThe treatment was little known in Bangladesh when OTEP began,\\n[\\n21\\n]\\nbut 15 years later it was used in rural households for severe diarrhoea more than 80% of the time, one of the highest rates in the world.\\n[\\n22\\n]\\nNon Formal Primary Education\\nwas started by BRAC in 1985.\\n[\\n23\\n]\\nIn 1979, BRAC started a Rural Development Programme (RDP).\\n[\\n24\\n]\\nThis was intended to give members access to credit and to savings facilities.\\n[\\n25\\n]\\nThe programme involved considerable growth in the number of people who were members of BRAC: in 1989, three years after the start of the Rural Development Programme, there were 350,000 members, and by 1995 there were 1.2 to 1.5 million members.\\n[\\n26\\n]\\nAn evaluation by the United Kingdom\\nDepartment for International Development\\nin 1998 found that the programme had been successful, though not all the aims were achieved.\\n[\\n25\\n]\\nBRAC's own evaluation in 1996 found \\\"gradual improvements in the indicators such as wealth, revenue earning assets, the value of house structure, the level of cash earned, per capita expenditure on food, total household expenditure\\\", but hoped-for improvements in village self-management had not taken place, and the drop-out rate of members was high.\\n[\\n25\\n]\\nIn 1991, the Women's Health Development programme commenced. The following year, BRAC established a Centre for Development Management (CDM) in\\nRajendrapur\\n.\\n[\\n27\\n]\\nBRAC opened an Information Technology Institute in 1999.\\n[\\n27\\n]\\nIn 2001, BRAC established a university in the city of Dhaka, Bangladesh, called\\nBRAC University\\n.\\n[\\n28\\n]\\nProgrammes\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nBRAC has done what few others have \\u2013 they have achieved success on a massive scale, bringing life-saving health programs to millions of the world's poorest people. They remind us that even the most intractable health problems are solvable, and inspire us to match their success throughout the developing world.\\nBill Gates\\n, Co-chair,\\nBill & Melinda Gates Foundation\\nGlobal Health Award, 2004\\nEconomic development\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nMicrofinance, introduced in 1974, is BRAC's oldest programme. It spans all districts of Bangladesh.\\n[\\n29\\n]\\n[\\n30\\n]\\nIt provides collateral-free loans to mostly poor, landless, rural women, enabling them to generate income and improve their\\nstandards of living\\n.\\n[\\n29\\n]\\n[\\n30\\n]\\nBRAC's microfinance program is estimated to give out around the equivalent of one billion dollars a year in loans.\\n[\\n31\\n]\\nBRAC founded its retail outlet, Aarong (Bengali for \\\"village fair\\\") in 1978 to market and distribute products made by indigenous peoples. Aarong services about 65,000 artisans, and sells gold and silver jewellery, handloom, leather crafts, etc.\\n[\\n13\\n]\\nThe Challenging the Frontiers of Poverty Reduction: Targeting the Ultra Poor (CFPR-TUP) project was started in 2002.\\n[\\n32\\n]\\nThe ultra-poor are a group of people who eat below 80% of their energy requirements, despite spending at least 80% of their income on food.\\n[\\n33\\n]\\nIn Bangladesh, they constitute the poorest 17.5 per cent of the population.\\n[\\n34\\n]\\nThese people suffer from chronic hunger and malnutrition, have inadequate shelter, are more prone to disease, are deprived of education, and are more vulnerable to recurring natural disasters. The CFPR-TUP programme is aimed at households that are too poor to access the benefits from development interventions such as\\nmicrofinance\\nand assists them to access mainstream development services. The program costs around US$35 million a year.\\n[\\n35\\n]\\nSome sources have argued that microcredit programs in Bangladesh, including those implemented by BRAC, may have unintended negative consequences for Bangladeshi women's economic status. Critics suggest that the financial assistance provided by BRAC might feed into the perception among local elites that women no longer require extra support. This perception may divert charitable giving's toward direct funding of religious institutions instead of direct aid to the impoverished.\\n[\\n36\\n]\\nEducation\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nBRAC is one of the largest NGOs involved in primary education in\\nBangladesh\\n.\\n[\\n37\\n]\\nSince 1974, BRAC's primary education efforts were observable with their circulation of\\nGonokendra,\\nan educational children's magazine, that BRAC sent to each of Bangladesh's primary schools. Soon they were circulating 3,000 issues monthly. Sponsored by UNICEF, they were able to disseminate 50,000 copies to the country's primary schools. BRAC continued developing education materials over the next few decades until, eventually, beginning to design their own primary and secondary school curriculum. In 1985, BRAC built 22 new one room schoolhouses, which constituted their \\\"Non-Formal Primary Education Program\\\" (NFPE). This was an effort to reduce illiteracy and truancy in Bangladeshi children, as well as address the education disparity between boys and girls.\\n[\\n38\\n]\\nIn 2018, BRAC educated over a million children have been educated worldwide.\\n[\\n39\\n]\\nIts schools constitute three-quarters of all NGO non-formal primary schools in the country.\\n[\\n37\\n]\\nBRAC's education programme provides\\nnon-formal primary education\\nto those left out of the formal education system, especially poor, rural, or disadvantaged children, and drop-outs.\\n[\\n40\\n]\\nIts schools are typically one room with one teacher and no more than 33 students.  Core subjects include mathematics, social studies and English. The schools also offer extracurricular activities.\\n[\\n37\\n]\\nThey incentivise schooling by providing food, allowing flexible learning hours, and conferring scholarships contingent on academic performance.\\n[\\n41\\n]\\nBangladesh has reduced the gap between male and female attendance in schools.\\n[\\n41\\n]\\nThe improvement in female enrollment, which has largely been at the primary level, is in part attributable to BRAC.\\n[\\n37\\n]\\nRoughly 60% of the students in their schools are girls.\\n[\\n40\\n]\\nBRAC also runs a university called BRAC University, located in Dhaka, Bangladesh. BRAC University offers a liberal arts university education. The primary language for education at BRAC University is English.

In order to receive foreign donations, BRAC was subsequently registered under the\\\\nNGO Affairs Bureau of the Government of Bangladesh\\\\n. BRAC is the largest\\\\nnon-governmental development organisation\\\\nin the world, in terms of the number of employees, as of September 2016.\\\\n[\\\\n3\\\\n]\\\\n[\\\\n4\\\\n]\\\\n[\\\\n5\\\\n]\\\\nFounded by\\\\nSir Fazle Hasan Abed\\\\nin 1972, shortly after the\\\\nindependence of Bangladesh\\\\n, BRAC now operates in all 64\\\\ndistricts of Bangladesh\\\\nand in 16 other countries across Asia, Africa, and the Americas.\\\\n[\\\\n6\\\\n]\\\\nBRAC states that it employs over 90,000 people, roughly 70 percent of whom are women, and that it reaches more than 126 million people with its services.\\\\n[\\\\n7\\\\n]\\\\n[\\\\n8\\\\n]\\\\n[\\\\n9\\\\n]\\\\nBRAC has operations in 12 countries.\\\\n[\\\\n7\\\\n]\\\\n[\\\\n10\\\\n]\\\\nHistory\\\\n[\\\\nedit\\\\n]\\\\nSir Fazle Hasan Abed\\\\n, founder of BRAC\\\\nKnown formerly as the Bangladesh Rehabilitation Assistance Committee, then as the Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee, and later as Building Resources Across Communities,\\\\n[\\\\n11\\\\n]\\\\nBRAC was initiated in 1972 by\\\\nSir Fazle Hasan Abed\\\\nat\\\\nShallah Upazillah\\\\nin the district of\\\\nSunamganj\\\\nas a large scale relief and rehabilitation project to help returning war refugees after the\\\\nBangladesh Liberation War\\\\nof 1971.\\\\n[\\\\n12\\\\n]\\\\nUntil the mid-1970s, BRAC concentrated on community development through village development programmes that included agriculture, fisheries,\\\\ncooperatives\\\\n, rural crafts,\\\\nadult literacy\\\\n, health and family planning, vocational training for women, and the construction of community centres. A Research and Evaluation Division (RED) was set up to evaluate its activities and decide direction, and in 1977, BRAC began taking a more targeted approach by creating Village Organisations (VO) to assist the landless, small farmers, artisans, and vulnerable women. That same year, BRAC set up a commercial printing press to help finance its activities. The handicraft retail chain called\\\\nAarong\\\\nwas established the following year.\\\\n[\\\\n13\\\\n]\\\\nIn the late 1970s,\\\\ndiarrhoea\\\\nwas a leading cause of\\\\nchild mortality\\\\nin Bangladesh.\\\\n[\\\\n14\\\\n]\\\\nIn February 1979, BRAC began a field trial in two villages of what was then\\\\nSulla thana\\\\n, of a campaign to combat diarrhoea.\\\\n[\\\\n15\\\\n]\\\\nThe following year, they scaled up the operation and named it the Oral Therapy Extension Programme (OTEP).\\\\n[\\\\n16\\\\n]\\\\nIt taught rural mothers in their homes how to prepare an\\\\noral rehydration solution\\\\n(ORS) from readily available ingredients and how to use it to treat diarrhoea.\\\\n[\\\\n17\\\\n]\\\\nThe training was reinforced with posters and radio and TV spots.\\\\n[\\\\n18\\\\n]\\\\nThe ten-year programme taught 12 million households spread over 75,000 villages in every part of Bangladesh except the Chittagong Hill Tracts (which were unsafe to work in because of civil unrest).\\\\n[\\\\n19\\\\n]\\\\nFifteen years after they were taught, the vast majority of mothers could still prepare a safe and effective ORS.\\\\n[\\\\n20\\\\n]\\\\nThe treatment was little known in Bangladesh when OTEP began,\\\\n[\\\\n21\\\\n]\\\\nbut 15 years later it was used in rural households for severe diarrhoea more than 80% of the time, one of the highest rates in the world.\\\\n[\\\\n22\\\\n]\\\\nNon Formal Primary Education\\\\nwas started by BRAC in 1985.\\\\n[\\\\n23\\\\n]\\\\nIn 1979, BRAC started a Rural Development Programme (RDP).\\\\n[\\\\n24\\\\n]\\\\nThis was intended to give members access to credit and to savings facilities.\\\\n[\\\\n25\\\\n]\\\\nThe programme involved considerable growth in the number of people who were members of BRAC: in 1989, three years after the start of the Rural Development Programme, there were 350,000 members, and by 1995 there were 1.2 to 1.5 million members.\\\\n[\\\\n26\\\\n]\\\\nAn evaluation by the United Kingdom\\\\nDepartment for International Development\\\\nin 1998 found that the programme had been successful, though not all the aims were achieved.\\\\n[\\\\n25\\\\n]\\\\nBRAC\\'s own evaluation in 1996 found \\\\\"gradual improvements in the indicators such as wealth, revenue earning assets, the value of house structure, the level of cash earned, per capita expenditure on food, total household expenditure\\\\\", but hoped-for improvements in village self-management had not taken place, and the drop-out rate of members was high.\\\\n[\\\\n25\\\\n]\\\\nIn 1991, the Women\\'s Health Development programme commenced. The following year, BRAC established a Centre for Development Management (CDM) in\\\\nRajendrapur\\\\n.\\\\n[\\\\n27\\\\n]\\\\nBRAC opened an Information Technology Institute in 1999.\\\\n[\\\\n27\\\\n]\\\\nIn 2001, BRAC established a university in the city of Dhaka, Bangladesh, called\\\\nBRAC University\\\\n.\\\\n[\\\\n28\\\\n]\\\\nProgrammes\\\\n[\\\\nedit\\\\n]\\\\nBRAC has done what few others have \\\\u2013 they have achieved success on a massive scale, bringing life-saving health programs to millions of the world\\'s poorest people. They remind us that even the most intractable health problems are solvable, and inspire us to match their success throughout the developing world.\\\\nBill Gates\\\\n, Co-chair,\\\\nBill & Melinda Gates Foundation\\\\nGlobal Health Award, 2004\\\\nEconomic development\\\\n[\\\\nedit\\\\n]\\\\nMicrofinance, introduced in 1974, is BRAC\\'s oldest programme. It spans all districts of Bangladesh.\\\\n[\\\\n29\\\\n]\\\\n[\\\\n30\\\\n]\\\\nIt provides collateral-free loans to mostly poor, landless, rural women, enabling them to generate income and improve their\\\\nstandards of living\\\\n.\\\\n[\\\\n29\\\\n]\\\\n[\\\\n30\\\\n]\\\\nBRAC\\'s microfinance program is estimated to give out around the equivalent of one billion dollars a year in loans.\\\\n[\\\\n31\\\\n]\\\\nBRAC founded its retail outlet, Aarong (Bengali for \\\\\"village fair\\\\\") in 1978 to market and distribute products made by indigenous peoples. Aarong services about 65,000 artisans, and sells gold and silver jewellery, handloom, leather crafts, etc.\\\\n[\\\\n13\\\\n]\\\\nThe Challenging the Frontiers of Poverty Reduction: Targeting the Ultra Poor (CFPR-TUP) project was started in 2002.\\\\n[\\\\n32\\\\n]\\\\nThe ultra-poor are a group of people who eat below 80% of their energy requirements, despite spending at least 80% of their income on food.\\\\n[\\\\n33\\\\n]\\\\nIn Bangladesh, they constitute the poorest 17.5 per cent of the population.\\\\n[\\\\n34\\\\n]\\\\nThese people suffer from chronic hunger and malnutrition, have inadequate shelter, are more prone to disease, are deprived of education, and are more vulnerable to recurring natural disasters. The CFPR-TUP programme is aimed at households that are too poor to access the benefits from development interventions such as\\\\nmicrofinance\\\\nand assists them to access mainstream development services. The program costs around US$35 million a year.\\\\n[\\\\n35\\\\n]\\\\nSome sources have argued that microcredit programs in Bangladesh, including those implemented by BRAC, may have unintended negative consequences for Bangladeshi women\\'s economic status. Critics suggest that the financial assistance provided by BRAC might feed into the perception among local elites that women no longer require extra support. This perception may divert charitable giving\\'s toward direct funding of religious institutions instead of direct aid to the impoverished.\\\\n[\\\\n36\\\\n]\\\\nEducation\\\\n[\\\\nedit\\\\n]\\\\nBRAC is one of the largest NGOs involved in primary education in\\\\nBangladesh\\\\n.\\\\n[\\\\n37\\\\n]\\\\nSince 1974, BRAC\\'s primary education efforts were observable with their circulation of\\\\nGonokendra,\\\\nan educational children\\'s magazine, that BRAC sent to each of Bangladesh\\'s primary schools. Soon they were circulating 3,000 issues monthly. Sponsored by UNICEF, they were able to disseminate 50,000 copies to the country\\'s primary schools. BRAC continued developing education materials over the next few decades until, eventually, beginning to design their own primary and secondary school curriculum. In 1985, BRAC built 22 new one room schoolhouses, which constituted their \\\\\"Non-Formal Primary Education Program\\\\\" (NFPE). This was an effort to reduce illiteracy and truancy in Bangladeshi children, as well as address the education disparity between boys and girls.\\\\n[\\\\n38\\\\n]\\\\nIn 2018, BRAC educated over a million children have been educated worldwide.\\\\n[\\\\n39\\\\n]\\\\nIts schools constitute three-quarters of all NGO non-formal primary schools in the country.\\\\n[\\\\n37\\\\n]\\\\nBRAC\\'s education programme provides\\\\nnon-formal primary education\\\\nto those left out of the formal education system, especially poor, rural, or disadvantaged children, and drop-outs.\\\\n[\\\\n40\\\\n]\\\\nIts schools are typically one room with one teacher and no more than 33 students.  Core subjects include mathematics, social studies and English. The schools also offer extracurricular activities.\\\\n[\\\\n37\\\\n]\\\\nThey incentivise schooling by providing food, allowing flexible learning hours, and conferring scholarships contingent on academic performance.\\\\n[\\\\n41\\\\n]\\\\nBangladesh has reduced the gap between male and female attendance in schools.\\\\n[\\\\n41\\\\n]\\\\nThe improvement in female enrollment, which has largely been at the primary level, is in part attributable to BRAC.\\\\n[\\\\n37\\\\n]\\\\nRoughly 60% of the students in their schools are girls.\\\\n[\\\\n40\\\\n]\\\\nBRAC also runs a university called BRAC University, located in Dhaka, Bangladesh. BRAC University offers a liberal arts university education. The primary language for education at BRAC University is English. BRAC University is officially accredited by the University Grants Commission (UGC) and operates with the approval of the Ministry of Education in Bangladesh\\\\n[\\\\n42\\\\n]\\\\nPublic health\\\\n[\\\\nedit\\\\n]\\\\nBRAC started providing public healthcare in 1972 with an initial focus on\\\\ncurative care\\\\nthrough paramedics and a self-financing health insurance scheme. The programme went on to provide integrated healthcare services to around 30 million people.\\\\n[\\\\n27\\\\n]\\\\nA BRAC community health worker conducting a survey in the Korail slum, Bangladesh\\\\nBRAC\\'s 2007 impact assessment of its North West Microfinance Expansion Project testified to increased awareness of legal issues, including those of marriage and divorce, among women participants in BRAC programs. Furthermore, women participants\\' self-confidence was boosted, and the incidence of domestic violence was found to have declined.\\\\n[\\\\n43\\\\n]\\\\nOne of the most prominent forms of violence against women,\\\\nacid throwing\\\\n, has been decreasing by 15-20% annually since the enactment in 2002 of legislation specifically targeting acid violence.\\\\n[\\\\n44\\\\n]\\\\nDisaster relief\\\\n[\\\\nedit\\\\n]\\\\nBRAC responded to\\\\nCyclone Sidr\\\\n, which hit vast areas of the south-western coast of Bangladesh in mid-November 2007.\\\\n[\\\\n45\\\\n]\\\\nBRAC provided emergency relief to survivors, like clothing, food, safe drinking water, and medical care.\\\\n[\\\\n46\\\\n]\\\\nBRAC is now focusing on long-term rehabilitation, which will include agriculture support, infrastructure reconstruction and livelihood regeneration.\\\\n[\\\\n45\\\\n]\\\\nPartnership with the Nike Foundation\\\\n[\\\\nedit\\\\n]\\\\nBRAC has a collaboration with\\\\nNike\\\\n\\'s Girl Effect campaign to launch a new program to reach out to teenagers in\\\\nUganda\\\\nand\\\\nTanzania\\\\n.\\\\n[\\\\n47\\\\n]\\\\n[\\\\n48\\\\n]\\\\nFinances\\\\n[\\\\nedit\\\\n]\\\\nDonors\\\\n[\\\\nedit\\\\n]\\\\nIn 2006, BRAC received donations from the\\\\nDirectorate-General for International Cooperation\\\\n(DGIS) and the government of the Netherlands / Embassy of the Kingdom of the Netherlands (EKN).\\\\n[\\\\n49\\\\n]\\\\nThe\\\\nBill and Melinda Gates Foundation\\\\n(BMGF) is on the list of BRAC donors, and in 2020 it committed multiple emergency response grants to BRAC and BRAC USA, totaling around the equivalent of US$600,000\\\\n[\\\\n50\\\\n]\\\\n[\\\\n51\\\\n]\\\\nIn 2012, the\\\\nDepartment for International Development\\\\n(DFID), the government of the UK and\\\\nDepartment of Foreign Affairs and Trade\\\\n(DFAT), and the Australian government (SPA) (under the strategic partnership arrangement) became BRAC donors as well.\\\\n[\\\\n52\\\\n]\\\\nRevenue\\\\n[\\\\nedit\\\\n]\\\\nBRAC is partly self-funded through a number of social enterprises. These include a retail fashion chain called\\\\nAarong\\\\nthat sells rural handicrafts, an agricultural seed business, a dairy, and a cold storage facility, among others. Between 2011 and 2015, surplus self-generated revenue from the organization\\'s enterprises averaged $17 million annually.\\\\n[\\\\n53\\\\n]\\\\nHistorian\\\\nTaj Hashmi\\\\nhas criticized BRAC\\'s projects for exploiting the cheap labour of rural women and children. An embroidered\\\\nsaree\\\\nretailed at Aarong for 6,000\\\\nBangladeshi taka\\\\n($120 as of 2000), for example, earned the embroiderer only 300 taka (less than $7).\\\\n[\\\\n54\\\\n]\\\\nGeographic scope\\\\n[\\\\nedit\\\\n]\\\\nBRAC operates in 13 countries.\\\\nAsia:\\\\nBangladesh\\\\n,\\\\nAfghanistan\\\\n,\\\\nSri Lanka\\\\n,\\\\nPakistan\\\\n,\\\\nPhilippines\\\\n,\\\\nNepal\\\\n,\\\\nMyanmar\\\\nAfrica:\\\\nUganda\\\\n,\\\\nRwanda\\\\n,\\\\nTanzania\\\\n,\\\\nSouth Sudan\\\\n,\\\\nLiberia\\\\n,\\\\nSierra Leone\\\\nCaribbean:\\\\nHaiti\\\\nBRAC provides technical assistance to organisations in\\\\nHaiti\\\\n,\\\\nSudan\\\\n, and\\\\nIndonesia\\\\nBRAC has affiliate organisations in the United Kingdom and the United States\\\\nHonours and awards\\\\n[\\\\nedit\\\\n]\\\\nIndependence Award\\\\n, 2007\\\\n[\\\\n55\\\\n]\\\\n[\\\\n56\\\\n]\\\\nNumber one NGO in the world, 2019 by NGO Advisor.\\\\n[\\\\n57\\\\n]\\\\nNumber one NGO in the world, 2018\\\\n[\\\\n58\\\\n]\\\\nNumber one NGO in the world, 2017 by NGO Advisor\\\\n[\\\\n59\\\\n]\\\\nNumber one NGO in the world, 2016 by NGO Advisor\\\\n[\\\\n60\\\\n]\\\\nSee also\\\\n[\\\\nedit\\\\n]\\\\nASA (NGO)\\\\nGrameen Bank\\\\nBrac IT Services Limited\\\\nReferences\\\\n[\\\\nedit\\\\n]\\\\n^\\\\na\\\\nb\\\\n\\\\\"Bangladesh Annual Report\\\\\"\\\\n(PDF)\\\\n.\\\\nBRAC\\\\n.\\\\nArchived\\\\n(PDF)\\\\nfrom the original on 14 December 2017\\\\n.

In order to receive foreign donations, BRAC was subsequently registered under the\\\\nNGO Affairs Bureau of the Government of Bangladesh\\\\n. BRAC is the largest\\\\nnon-governmental development organisation\\\\nin the world, in terms of the number of employees, as of September 2016.\\\\n[\\\\n3\\\\n]\\\\n[\\\\n4\\\\n]\\\\n[\\\\n5\\\\n]\\\\nFounded by\\\\nSir Fazle Hasan Abed\\\\nin 1972, shortly after the\\\\nindependence of Bangladesh\\\\n, BRAC now operates in all 64\\\\ndistricts of Bangladesh\\\\nand in 16 other countries across Asia, Africa, and the Americas.\\\\n[\\\\n6\\\\n]\\\\nBRAC states that it employs over 90,000 people, roughly 70 percent of whom are women, and that it reaches more than 126 million people with its services.\\\\n[\\\\n7\\\\n]\\\\n[\\\\n8\\\\n]\\\\n[\\\\n9\\\\n]\\\\nBRAC has operations in 12 countries.\\\\n[\\\\n7\\\\n]\\\\n[\\\\n10\\\\n]\\\\nHistory\\\\n[\\\\nedit\\\\n]\\\\nSir Fazle Hasan Abed\\\\n, founder of BRAC\\\\nKnown formerly as the Bangladesh Rehabilitation Assistance Committee, then as the Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee, and later as Building Resources Across Communities,\\\\n[\\\\n11\\\\n]\\\\nBRAC was initiated in 1972 by\\\\nSir Fazle Hasan Abed\\\\nat\\\\nShallah Upazillah\\\\nin the district of\\\\nSunamganj\\\\nas a large scale relief and rehabilitation project to help returning war refugees after the\\\\nBangladesh Liberation War\\\\nof 1971.\\\\n[\\\\n12\\\\n]\\\\nUntil the mid-1970s, BRAC concentrated on community development through village development programmes that included agriculture, fisheries,\\\\ncooperatives\\\\n, rural crafts,\\\\nadult literacy\\\\n, health and family planning, vocational training for women, and the construction of community centres. A Research and Evaluation Division (RED) was set up to evaluate its activities and decide direction, and in 1977, BRAC began taking a more targeted approach by creating Village Organisations (VO) to assist the landless, small farmers, artisans, and vulnerable women. That same year, BRAC set up a commercial printing press to help finance its activities. The handicraft retail chain called\\\\nAarong\\\\nwas established the following year.\\\\n[\\\\n13\\\\n]\\\\nIn the late 1970s,\\\\ndiarrhoea\\\\nwas a leading cause of\\\\nchild mortality\\\\nin Bangladesh.\\\\n[\\\\n14\\\\n]\\\\nIn February 1979, BRAC began a field trial in two villages of what was then\\\\nSulla thana\\\\n, of a campaign to combat diarrhoea.\\\\n[\\\\n15\\\\n]\\\\nThe following year, they scaled up the operation and named it the Oral Therapy Extension Programme (OTEP).\\\\n[\\\\n16\\\\n]\\\\nIt taught rural mothers in their homes how to prepare an\\\\noral rehydration solution\\\\n(ORS) from readily available ingredients and how to use it to treat diarrhoea.\\\\n[\\\\n17\\\\n]\\\\nThe training was reinforced with posters and radio and TV spots.\\\\n[\\\\n18\\\\n]\\\\nThe ten-year programme taught 12 million households spread over 75,000 villages in every part of Bangladesh except the Chittagong Hill Tracts (which were unsafe to work in because of civil unrest).\\\\n[\\\\n19\\\\n]\\\\nFifteen years after they were taught, the vast majority of mothers could still prepare a safe and effective ORS.\\\\n[\\\\n20\\\\n]\\\\nThe treatment was little known in Bangladesh when OTEP began,\\\\n[\\\\n21\\\\n]\\\\nbut 15 years later it was used in rural households for severe diarrhoea more than 80% of the time, one of the highest rates in the world.\\\\n[\\\\n22\\\\n]\\\\nNon Formal Primary Education\\\\nwas started by BRAC in 1985.\\\\n[\\\\n23\\\\n]\\\\nIn 1979, BRAC started a Rural Development Programme (RDP).\\\\n[\\\\n24\\\\n]\\\\nThis was intended to give members access to credit and to savings facilities.\\\\n[\\\\n25\\\\n]\\\\nThe programme involved considerable growth in the number of people who were members of BRAC: in 1989, three years after the start of the Rural Development Programme, there were 350,000 members, and by 1995 there were 1.2 to 1.5 million members.\\\\n[\\\\n26\\\\n]\\\\nAn evaluation by the United Kingdom\\\\nDepartment for International Development\\\\nin 1998 found that the programme had been successful, though not all the aims were achieved.\\\\n[\\\\n25\\\\n]\\\\nBRAC\\'s own evaluation in 1996 found \\\\\"gradual improvements in the indicators such as wealth, revenue earning assets, the value of house structure, the level of cash earned, per capita expenditure on food, total household expenditure\\\\\", but hoped-for improvements in village self-management had not taken place, and the drop-out rate of members was high.\\\\n[\\\\n25\\\\n]\\\\nIn 1991, the Women\\'s Health Development programme commenced. The following year, BRAC established a Centre for Development Management (CDM) in\\\\nRajendrapur\\\\n.\\\\n[\\\\n27\\\\n]\\\\nBRAC opened an Information Technology Institute in 1999.\\\\n[\\\\n27\\\\n]\\\\nIn 2001, BRAC established a university in the city of Dhaka, Bangladesh, called\\\\nBRAC University\\\\n.\\\\n[\\\\n28\\\\n]\\\\nProgrammes\\\\n[\\\\nedit\\\\n]\\\\nBRAC has done what few others have \\\\u2013 they have achieved success on a massive scale, bringing life-saving health programs to millions of the world\\'s poorest people. They remind us that even the most intractable health problems are solvable, and inspire us to match their success throughout the developing world.\\\\nBill Gates\\\\n, Co-chair,\\\\nBill & Melinda Gates Foundation\\\\nGlobal Health Award, 2004\\\\nEconomic development\\\\n[\\\\nedit\\\\n]\\\\nMicrofinance, introduced in 1974, is BRAC\\'s oldest programme. It spans all districts of Bangladesh.\\\\n[\\\\n29\\\\n]\\\\n[\\\\n30\\\\n]\\\\nIt provides collateral-free loans to mostly poor, landless, rural women, enabling them to generate income and improve their\\\\nstandards of living\\\\n.\\\\n[\\\\n29\\\\n]\\\\n[\\\\n30\\\\n]\\\\nBRAC\\'s microfinance program is estimated to give out around the equivalent of one billion dollars a year in loans.\\\\n[\\\\n31\\\\n]\\\\nBRAC founded its retail outlet, Aarong (Bengali for \\\\\"village fair\\\\\") in 1978 to market and distribute products made by indigenous peoples. Aarong services about 65,000 artisans, and sells gold and silver jewellery, handloom, leather crafts, etc.\\\\n[\\\\n13\\\\n]\\\\nThe Challenging the Frontiers of Poverty Reduction: Targeting the Ultra Poor (CFPR-TUP) project was started in 2002.\\\\n[\\\\n32\\\\n]\\\\nThe ultra-poor are a group of people who eat below 80% of their energy requirements, despite spending at least 80% of their income on food.\\\\n[\\\\n33\\\\n]\\\\nIn Bangladesh, they constitute the poorest 17.5 per cent of the population.\\\\n[\\\\n34\\\\n]\\\\nThese people suffer from chronic hunger and malnutrition, have inadequate shelter, are more prone to disease, are deprived of education, and are more vulnerable to recurring natural disasters. The CFPR-TUP programme is aimed at households that are too poor to access the benefits from development interventions such as\\\\nmicrofinance\\\\nand assists them to access mainstream development services. The program costs around US$35 million a year.\\\\n[\\\\n35\\\\n]\\\\nSome sources have argued that microcredit programs in Bangladesh, including those implemented by BRAC, may have unintended negative consequences for Bangladeshi women\\'s economic status. Critics suggest that the financial assistance provided by BRAC might feed into the perception among local elites that women no longer require extra support. This perception may divert charitable giving\\'s toward direct funding of religious institutions instead of direct aid to the impoverished.\\\\n[\\\\n36\\\\n]\\\\nEducation\\\\n[\\\\nedit\\\\n]\\\\nBRAC is one of the largest NGOs involved in primary education in\\\\nBangladesh\\\\n.\\\\n[\\\\n37\\\\n]\\\\nSince 1974, BRAC\\'s primary education efforts were observable with their circulation of\\\\nGonokendra,\\\\nan educational children\\'s magazine, that BRAC sent to each of Bangladesh\\'s primary schools. Soon they were circulating 3,000 issues monthly. Sponsored by UNICEF, they were able to disseminate 50,000 copies to the country\\'s primary schools. BRAC continued developing education materials over the next few decades until, eventually, beginning to design their own primary and secondary school curriculum. In 1985, BRAC built 22 new one room schoolhouses, which constituted their \\\\\"Non-Formal Primary Education Program\\\\\" (NFPE). This was an effort to reduce illiteracy and truancy in Bangladeshi children, as well as address the education disparity between boys and girls.\\\\n[\\\\n38\\\\n]\\\\nIn 2018, BRAC educated over a million children have been educated worldwide.\\\\n[\\\\n39\\\\n]\\\\nIts schools constitute three-quarters of all NGO non-formal primary schools in the country.\\\\n[\\\\n37\\\\n]\\\\nBRAC\\'s education programme provides\\\\nnon-formal primary education\\\\nto those left out of the formal education system, especially poor, rural, or disadvantaged children, and drop-outs.\\\\n[\\\\n40\\\\n]\\\\nIts schools are typically one room with one teacher and no more than 33 students.  Core subjects include mathematics, social studies and English. The schools also offer extracurricular activities.\\\\n[\\\\n37\\\\n]\\\\nThey incentivise schooling by providing food, allowing flexible learning hours, and conferring scholarships contingent on academic performance.\\\\n[\\\\n41\\\\n]\\\\nBangladesh has reduced the gap between male and female attendance in schools.\\\\n[\\\\n41\\\\n]\\\\nThe improvement in female enrollment, which has largely been at the primary level, is in part attributable to BRAC.\\\\n[\\\\n37\\\\n]\\\\nRoughly 60% of the students in their schools are girls.\\\\n[\\\\n40\\\\n]\\\\nBRAC also runs a university called BRAC University, located in Dhaka, Bangladesh. BRAC University offers a liberal arts university education. The primary language for education at BRAC University is English. BRAC University is officially accredited by the University Grants Commission (UGC) and operates with the approval of the Ministry of Education in Bangladesh\\\\n[\\\\n42\\\\n]\\\\nPublic health\\\\n[\\\\nedit\\\\n]\\\\nBRAC started providing public healthcare in 1972 with an initial focus on\\\\ncurative care\\\\nthrough paramedics and a self-financing health insurance scheme. The programme went on to provide integrated healthcare services to around 30 million people.\\\\n[\\\\n27\\\\n]\\\\nA BRAC community health worker conducting a survey in the Korail slum, Bangladesh\\\\nBRAC\\'s 2007 impact assessment of its North West Microfinance Expansion Project testified to increased awareness of legal issues, including those of marriage and divorce, among women participants in BRAC programs. Furthermore, women participants\\' self-confidence was boosted, and the incidence of domestic violence was found to have declined.\\\\n[\\\\n43\\\\n]\\\\nOne of the most prominent forms of violence against women,\\\\nacid throwing\\\\n, has been decreasing by 15-20% annually since the enactment in 2002 of legislation specifically targeting acid violence.\\\\n[\\\\n44\\\\n]\\\\nDisaster relief\\\\n[\\\\nedit\\\\n]\\\\nBRAC responded to\\\\nCyclone Sidr\\\\n, which hit vast areas of the south-western coast of Bangladesh in mid-November 2007.\\\\n[\\\\n45\\\\n]\\\\nBRAC provided emergency relief to survivors, like clothing, food, safe drinking water, and medical care.\\\\n[\\\\n46\\\\n]\\\\nBRAC is now focusing on long-term rehabilitation, which will include agriculture support, infrastructure reconstruction and livelihood regeneration.\\\\n[\\\\n45\\\\n]\\\\nPartnership with the Nike Foundation\\\\n[\\\\nedit\\\\n]\\\\nBRAC has a collaboration with\\\\nNike\\\\n\\'s Girl Effect campaign to launch a new program to reach out to teenagers in\\\\nUganda\\\\nand\\\\nTanzania\\\\n.\\\\n[\\\\n47\\\\n]\\\\n[\\\\n48\\\\n]\\\\nFinances\\\\n[\\\\nedit\\\\n]\\\\nDonors\\\\n[\\\\nedit\\\\n]\\\\nIn 2006, BRAC received donations from the\\\\nDirectorate-General for International Cooperation\\\\n(DGIS) and the government of the Netherlands / Embassy of the Kingdom of the Netherlands (EKN).\\\\n[\\\\n49\\\\n]\\\\nThe\\\\nBill and Melinda Gates Foundation\\\\n(BMGF) is on the list of BRAC donors, and in 2020 it committed multiple emergency response grants to BRAC and BRAC USA, totaling around the equivalent of US$600,000\\\\n[\\\\n50\\\\n]\\\\n[\\\\n51\\\\n]\\\\nIn 2012, the\\\\nDepartment for International Development\\\\n(DFID), the government of the UK and\\\\nDepartment of Foreign Affairs and Trade\\\\n(DFAT), and the Australian government (SPA) (under the strategic partnership arrangement) became BRAC donors as well.\\\\n[\\\\n52\\\\n]\\\\nRevenue\\\\n[\\\\nedit\\\\n]\\\\nBRAC is partly self-funded through a number of social enterprises. These include a retail fashion chain called\\\\nAarong\\\\nthat sells rural handicrafts, an agricultural seed business, a dairy, and a cold storage facility, among others. Between 2011 and 2015, surplus self-generated revenue from the organization\\'s enterprises averaged $17 million annually.\\\\n[\\\\n53\\\\n]\\\\nHistorian\\\\nTaj Hashmi\\\\nhas criticized BRAC\\'s projects for exploiting the cheap labour of rural women and children. An embroidered\\\\nsaree\\\\nretailed at Aarong for 6,000\\\\nBangladeshi taka\\\\n($120 as of 2000), for example, earned the embroiderer only 300 taka (less than $7).\\\\n[\\\\n54\\\\n]\\\\nGeographic scope\\\\n[\\\\nedit\\\\n]\\\\nBRAC operates in 13 countries.\\\\nAsia:\\\\nBangladesh\\\\n,\\\\nAfghanistan\\\\n,\\\\nSri Lanka\\\\n,\\\\nPakistan\\\\n,\\\\nPhilippines\\\\n,\\\\nNepal\\\\n,\\\\nMyanmar\\\\nAfrica:\\\\nUganda\\\\n,\\\\nRwanda\\\\n,\\\\nTanzania\\\\n,\\\\nSouth Sudan\\\\n,\\\\nLiberia\\\\n,\\\\nSierra Leone\\\\nCaribbean:\\\\nHaiti\\\\nBRAC provides technical assistance to organisations in\\\\nHaiti\\\\n,\\\\nSudan\\\\n, and\\\\nIndonesia\\\\nBRAC has affiliate organisations in the United Kingdom and the United States\\\\nHonours and awards\\\\n[\\\\nedit\\\\n]\\\\nIndependence Award\\\\n, 2007\\\\n[\\\\n55\\\\n]\\\\n[\\\\n56\\\\n]\\\\nNumber one NGO in the world, 2019 by NGO Advisor.\\\\n[\\\\n57\\\\n]\\\\nNumber one NGO in the world, 2018\\\\n[\\\\n58\\\\n]\\\\nNumber one NGO in the world, 2017 by NGO Advisor\\\\n[\\\\n59\\\\n]\\\\nNumber one NGO in the world, 2016 by NGO Advisor\\\\n[\\\\n60\\\\n]\\\\nSee also\\\\n[\\\\nedit\\\\n]\\\\nASA (NGO)\\\\nGrameen Bank\\\\nBrac IT Services Limited\\\\nReferences\\\\n[\\\\nedit\\\\n]\\\\n^\\\\na\\\\nb\\\\n\\\\\"Bangladesh Annual Report\\\\\"\\\\n(PDF)\\\\n.\\\\nBRAC\\\\n.\\\\nArchived\\\\n(PDF)\\\\nfrom the original on 14 December 2017\\\\n.

Kamruzzaman\\n[\\n1\\n]\\nWebsite\\nbangladeshmuseum\\n.gov\\n.bd\\nThe Bangladesh National Museum is the national repository of Bangladesh's cultural and historical artifacts, located in the Shahbag area of Dhaka. It was established on March 20, 1913, under the name Dhaka Museum, and was formally inaugurated on August 7, 1913. With an initial collection of 379 objects, it was opened to the public on August 25, 1914.\\n[\\n2\\n]\\nAfter the independence of Bangladesh in 1971, the institution was reorganized under the name Bangladesh National Museum, incorporating various parts of the former Dhaka Museum, and was formally inaugurated in its present form in 1983.\\n[\\n3\\n]\\nThe museum has departments of ethnography and decorative art, history and classical art, natural history, and world civilization. Artifacts from the prehistoric era to contemporary history are displayed here, which include over 50,000 ancient and medieval coins, Buddhist sculptures from the Gandhara period, and exhibitions related to the 1971 Liberation War.\\n[\\n4\\n]\\nThe idol of\\nRishabhdeva\\nin seated posture in display.\\nHistory\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nBangladesh National Museum designed by\\nSyed Mainul Hossain\\nIn 1855, the Asiatic Society of Bengal proposed establishing a museum in Dhaka, but it was postponed due to logistical constraints. Later, in 1907, this initiative re-emerged among the elite class of Dhaka. Following this, on March 20, 1913, the Dhaka Museum was formally established by the government of undivided Bengal. It was initially located in a room of the old Secretariat building (later part of Dhaka Medical College Hospital). The institution was supported by subscriptions amounting to nearly 10,000 taka from the residents of Dhaka and an initial government grant of 2,000 taka. On August 7, 1913, the Lieutenant Governor of Bengal, Lord Thomas David Gibson Carmichael, inaugurated it for the public in the old building of Jagannath University College, in the presence of local dignitaries. The initial collection comprised about 500 items, primarily including regional archaeological artifacts, coins, manuscripts, and folk art.\\n[\\n5\\n]\\nAs the collection grew, it was relocated to the Nimtali Baroduari building by 1915.\\n[\\n6\\n]\\nAfter the partition of India in 1947, the institution continued to operate as the Dhaka Museum in East Pakistan and faced several administrative challenges. For example, following the death of its first curator, Nalini Kanta Bhattasali, there was no permanent curator from 1947 to 1951, and during this time, its premises were temporarily occupied by a press agency.\\n[\\n7\\n]\\nA part-time curator was appointed in 1951-1952, and in 1954, Enayetur Rahman joined as the curator. Exhibits from sites damaged by the attacks of the Pakistan Army in 1971 (such as the Dinajpur Rajbari and Baldha Museum) were transferred here. Additionally, the collection of war-related documents and artifacts began with the aim of documenting information about the Bengali liberation struggle.\\n[\\n8\\n]\\nAfter independence, in 1972, the institution was renamed 'Bangladesh National Museum' in line with the identity of the newly independent state, and it officially received this name through a government order in 1974. A Trustee Board was formed in 1970 and a National Museum Commission in 1974 for its oversight. As part of the restructuring during the 1970s and 1980s, a new site for the museum in Shahbagh was approved by ECNEC in December 1975. Specialized curatorial departments, such as anthropology, decorative arts, and history, were established to manage the growing collection. Finally, on November 17, 1983, the new building in Shahbagh, equipped with modern facilities, was opened to the public.\\n[\\n9\\n]\\nBy 2017, as a result of ongoing acquisitions and research, the collection of the Bangladesh National Museum reached 91,287 artifacts, among which historical, ethnographic, and natural history items are particularly noteworthy.\\n[\\n10\\n]\\nAs part of a broader institutional modernization, the museum initiated a digitization project in 2012.

BRAC is the largest\\\\nnon-governmental development organisation\\\\nin the world, in terms of the number of employees, as of September 2016.\\\\n[\\\\n3\\\\n]\\\\n[\\\\n4\\\\n]\\\\n[\\\\n5\\\\n]\\\\nFounded by\\\\nSir Fazle Hasan Abed\\\\nin 1972, shortly after the\\\\nindependence of Bangladesh\\\\n, BRAC now operates in all 64\\\\ndistricts of Bangladesh\\\\nand in 16 other countries across Asia, Africa, and the Americas.\\\\n[\\\\n6\\\\n]\\\\nBRAC states that it employs over 90,000 people, roughly 70 percent of whom are women, and that it reaches more than 126 million people with its services.\\\\n[\\\\n7\\\\n]\\\\n[\\\\n8\\\\n]\\\\n[\\\\n9\\\\n]\\\\nBRAC has operations in 12 countries.\\\\n[\\\\n7\\\\n]\\\\n[\\\\n10\\\\n]\\\\nHistory\\\\n[\\\\nedit\\\\n]\\\\nSir Fazle Hasan Abed\\\\n, founder of BRAC\\\\nKnown formerly as the Bangladesh Rehabilitation Assistance Committee, then as the Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee, and later as Building Resources Across Communities,\\\\n[\\\\n11\\\\n]\\\\nBRAC was initiated in 1972 by\\\\nSir Fazle Hasan Abed\\\\nat\\\\nShallah Upazillah\\\\nin the district of\\\\nSunamganj\\\\nas a large scale relief and rehabilitation project to help returning war refugees after the\\\\nBangladesh Liberation War\\\\nof 1971.\\\\n[\\\\n12\\\\n]\\\\nUntil the mid-1970s, BRAC concentrated on community development through village development programmes that included agriculture, fisheries,\\\\ncooperatives\\\\n, rural crafts,\\\\nadult literacy\\\\n, health and family planning, vocational training for women, and the construction of community centres. A Research and Evaluation Division (RED) was set up to evaluate its activities and decide direction, and in 1977, BRAC began taking a more targeted approach by creating Village Organisations (VO) to assist the landless, small farmers, artisans, and vulnerable women. That same year, BRAC set up a commercial printing press to help finance its activities. The handicraft retail chain called\\\\nAarong\\\\nwas established the following year.\\\\n[\\\\n13\\\\n]\\\\nIn the late 1970s,\\\\ndiarrhoea\\\\nwas a leading cause of\\\\nchild mortality\\\\nin Bangladesh.\\\\n[\\\\n14\\\\n]\\\\nIn February 1979, BRAC began a field trial in two villages of what was then\\\\nSulla thana\\\\n, of a campaign to combat diarrhoea.\\\\n[\\\\n15\\\\n]\\\\nThe following year, they scaled up the operation and named it the Oral Therapy Extension Programme (OTEP).\\\\n[\\\\n16\\\\n]\\\\nIt taught rural mothers in their homes how to prepare an\\\\noral rehydration solution\\\\n(ORS) from readily available ingredients and how to use it to treat diarrhoea.\\\\n[\\\\n17\\\\n]\\\\nThe training was reinforced with posters and radio and TV spots.\\\\n[\\\\n18\\\\n]\\\\nThe ten-year programme taught 12 million households spread over 75,000 villages in every part of Bangladesh except the Chittagong Hill Tracts (which were unsafe to work in because of civil unrest).\\\\n[\\\\n19\\\\n]\\\\nFifteen years after they were taught, the vast majority of mothers could still prepare a safe and effective ORS.\\\\n[\\\\n20\\\\n]\\\\nThe treatment was little known in Bangladesh when OTEP began,\\\\n[\\\\n21\\\\n]\\\\nbut 15 years later it was used in rural households for severe diarrhoea more than 80% of the time, one of the highest rates in the world.\\\\n[\\\\n22\\\\n]\\\\nNon Formal Primary Education\\\\nwas started by BRAC in 1985.\\\\n[\\\\n23\\\\n]\\\\nIn 1979, BRAC started a Rural Development Programme (RDP).\\\\n[\\\\n24\\\\n]\\\\nThis was intended to give members access to credit and to savings facilities.\\\\n[\\\\n25\\\\n]\\\\nThe programme involved considerable growth in the number of people who were members of BRAC: in 1989, three years after the start of the Rural Development Programme, there were 350,000 members, and by 1995 there were 1.2 to 1.5 million members.\\\\n[\\\\n26\\\\n]\\\\nAn evaluation by the United Kingdom\\\\nDepartment for International Development\\\\nin 1998 found that the programme had been successful, though not all the aims were achieved.\\\\n[\\\\n25\\\\n]\\\\nBRAC\\'s own evaluation in 1996 found \\\\\"gradual improvements in the indicators such as wealth, revenue earning assets, the value of house structure, the level of cash earned, per capita expenditure on food, total household expenditure\\\\\", but hoped-for improvements in village self-management had not taken place, and the drop-out rate of members was high.\\\\n[\\\\n25\\\\n]\\\\nIn 1991, the Women\\'s Health Development programme commenced. The following year, BRAC established a Centre for Development Management (CDM) in\\\\nRajendrapur\\\\n.\\\\n[\\\\n27\\\\n]\\\\nBRAC opened an Information Technology Institute in 1999.\\\\n[\\\\n27\\\\n]\\\\nIn 2001, BRAC established a university in the city of Dhaka, Bangladesh, called\\\\nBRAC University\\\\n.\\\\n[\\\\n28\\\\n]\\\\nProgrammes\\\\n[\\\\nedit\\\\n]\\\\nBRAC has done what few others have \\\\u2013 they have achieved success on a massive scale, bringing life-saving health programs to millions of the world\\'s poorest people. They remind us that even the most intractable health problems are solvable, and inspire us to match their success throughout the developing world.\\\\nBill Gates\\\\n, Co-chair,\\\\nBill & Melinda Gates Foundation\\\\nGlobal Health Award, 2004\\\\nEconomic development\\\\n[\\\\nedit\\\\n]\\\\nMicrofinance, introduced in 1974, is BRAC\\'s oldest programme. It spans all districts of Bangladesh.\\\\n[\\\\n29\\\\n]\\\\n[\\\\n30\\\\n]\\\\nIt provides collateral-free loans to mostly poor, landless, rural women, enabling them to generate income and improve their\\\\nstandards of living\\\\n.\\\\n[\\\\n29\\\\n]\\\\n[\\\\n30\\\\n]\\\\nBRAC\\'s microfinance program is estimated to give out around the equivalent of one billion dollars a year in loans.\\\\n[\\\\n31\\\\n]\\\\nBRAC founded its retail outlet, Aarong (Bengali for \\\\\"village fair\\\\\") in 1978 to market and distribute products made by indigenous peoples. Aarong services about 65,000 artisans, and sells gold and silver jewellery, handloom, leather crafts, etc.\\\\n[\\\\n13\\\\n]\\\\nThe Challenging the Frontiers of Poverty Reduction: Targeting the Ultra Poor (CFPR-TUP) project was started in 2002.\\\\n[\\\\n32\\\\n]\\\\nThe ultra-poor are a group of people who eat below 80% of their energy requirements, despite spending at least 80% of their income on food.\\\\n[\\\\n33\\\\n]\\\\nIn Bangladesh, they constitute the poorest 17.5 per cent of the population.\\\\n[\\\\n34\\\\n]\\\\nThese people suffer from chronic hunger and malnutrition, have inadequate shelter, are more prone to disease, are deprived of education, and are more vulnerable to recurring natural disasters. The CFPR-TUP programme is aimed at households that are too poor to access the benefits from development interventions such as\\\\nmicrofinance\\\\nand assists them to access mainstream development services. The program costs around US$35 million a year.\\\\n[\\\\n35\\\\n]\\\\nSome sources have argued that microcredit programs in Bangladesh, including those implemented by BRAC, may have unintended negative consequences for Bangladeshi women\\'s economic status. Critics suggest that the financial assistance provided by BRAC might feed into the perception among local elites that women no longer require extra support. This perception may divert charitable giving\\'s toward direct funding of religious institutions instead of direct aid to the impoverished.\\\\n[\\\\n36\\\\n]\\\\nEducation\\\\n[\\\\nedit\\\\n]\\\\nBRAC is one of the largest NGOs involved in primary education in\\\\nBangladesh\\\\n.\\\\n[\\\\n37\\\\n]\\\\nSince 1974, BRAC\\'s primary education efforts were observable with their circulation of\\\\nGonokendra,\\\\nan educational children\\'s magazine, that BRAC sent to each of Bangladesh\\'s primary schools. Soon they were circulating 3,000 issues monthly. Sponsored by UNICEF, they were able to disseminate 50,000 copies to the country\\'s primary schools. BRAC continued developing education materials over the next few decades until, eventually, beginning to design their own primary and secondary school curriculum. In 1985, BRAC built 22 new one room schoolhouses, which constituted their \\\\\"Non-Formal Primary Education Program\\\\\" (NFPE). This was an effort to reduce illiteracy and truancy in Bangladeshi children, as well as address the education disparity between boys and girls.\\\\n[\\\\n38\\\\n]\\\\nIn 2018, BRAC educated over a million children have been educated worldwide.\\\\n[\\\\n39\\\\n]\\\\nIts schools constitute three-quarters of all NGO non-formal primary schools in the country.\\\\n[\\\\n37\\\\n]\\\\nBRAC\\'s education programme provides\\\\nnon-formal primary education\\\\nto those left out of the formal education system, especially poor, rural, or disadvantaged children, and drop-outs.\\\\n[\\\\n40\\\\n]\\\\nIts schools are typically one room with one teacher and no more than 33 students.  Core subjects include mathematics, social studies and English. The schools also offer extracurricular activities.\\\\n[\\\\n37\\\\n]\\\\nThey incentivise schooling by providing food, allowing flexible learning hours, and conferring scholarships contingent on academic performance.\\\\n[\\\\n41\\\\n]\\\\nBangladesh has reduced the gap between male and female attendance in schools.\\\\n[\\\\n41\\\\n]\\\\nThe improvement in female enrollment, which has largely been at the primary level, is in part attributable to BRAC.\\\\n[\\\\n37\\\\n]\\\\nRoughly 60% of the students in their schools are girls.\\\\n[\\\\n40\\\\n]\\\\nBRAC also runs a university called BRAC University, located in Dhaka, Bangladesh. BRAC University offers a liberal arts university education. The primary language for education at BRAC University is English. BRAC University is officially accredited by the University Grants Commission (UGC) and operates with the approval of the Ministry of Education in Bangladesh\\\\n[\\\\n42\\\\n]\\\\nPublic health\\\\n[\\\\nedit\\\\n]\\\\nBRAC started providing public healthcare in 1972 with an initial focus on\\\\ncurative care\\\\nthrough paramedics and a self-financing health insurance scheme. The programme went on to provide integrated healthcare services to around 30 million people.\\\\n[\\\\n27\\\\n]\\\\nA BRAC community health worker conducting a survey in the Korail slum, Bangladesh\\\\nBRAC\\'s 2007 impact assessment of its North West Microfinance Expansion Project testified to increased awareness of legal issues, including those of marriage and divorce, among women participants in BRAC programs. Furthermore, women participants\\' self-confidence was boosted, and the incidence of domestic violence was found to have declined.\\\\n[\\\\n43\\\\n]\\\\nOne of the most prominent forms of violence against women,\\\\nacid throwing\\\\n, has been decreasing by 15-20% annually since the enactment in 2002 of legislation specifically targeting acid violence.\\\\n[\\\\n44\\\\n]\\\\nDisaster relief\\\\n[\\\\nedit\\\\n]\\\\nBRAC responded to\\\\nCyclone Sidr\\\\n, which hit vast areas of the south-western coast of Bangladesh in mid-November 2007.\\\\n[\\\\n45\\\\n]\\\\nBRAC provided emergency relief to survivors, like clothing, food, safe drinking water, and medical care.\\\\n[\\\\n46\\\\n]\\\\nBRAC is now focusing on long-term rehabilitation, which will include agriculture support, infrastructure reconstruction and livelihood regeneration.\\\\n[\\\\n45\\\\n]\\\\nPartnership with the Nike Foundation\\\\n[\\\\nedit\\\\n]\\\\nBRAC has a collaboration with\\\\nNike\\\\n\\'s Girl Effect campaign to launch a new program to reach out to teenagers in\\\\nUganda\\\\nand\\\\nTanzania\\\\n.\\\\n[\\\\n47\\\\n]\\\\n[\\\\n48\\\\n]\\\\nFinances\\\\n[\\\\nedit\\\\n]\\\\nDonors\\\\n[\\\\nedit\\\\n]\\\\nIn 2006, BRAC received donations from the\\\\nDirectorate-General for International Cooperation\\\\n(DGIS) and the government of the Netherlands / Embassy of the Kingdom of the Netherlands (EKN).\\\\n[\\\\n49\\\\n]\\\\nThe\\\\nBill and Melinda Gates Foundation\\\\n(BMGF) is on the list of BRAC donors, and in 2020 it committed multiple emergency response grants to BRAC and BRAC USA, totaling around the equivalent of US$600,000\\\\n[\\\\n50\\\\n]\\\\n[\\\\n51\\\\n]\\\\nIn 2012, the\\\\nDepartment for International Development\\\\n(DFID), the government of the UK and\\\\nDepartment of Foreign Affairs and Trade\\\\n(DFAT), and the Australian government (SPA) (under the strategic partnership arrangement) became BRAC donors as well.\\\\n[\\\\n52\\\\n]\\\\nRevenue\\\\n[\\\\nedit\\\\n]\\\\nBRAC is partly self-funded through a number of social enterprises. These include a retail fashion chain called\\\\nAarong\\\\nthat sells rural handicrafts, an agricultural seed business, a dairy, and a cold storage facility, among others. Between 2011 and 2015, surplus self-generated revenue from the organization\\'s enterprises averaged $17 million annually.\\\\n[\\\\n53\\\\n]\\\\nHistorian\\\\nTaj Hashmi\\\\nhas criticized BRAC\\'s projects for exploiting the cheap labour of rural women and children. An embroidered\\\\nsaree\\\\nretailed at Aarong for 6,000\\\\nBangladeshi taka\\\\n($120 as of 2000), for example, earned the embroiderer only 300 taka (less than $7).\\\\n[\\\\n54\\\\n]\\\\nGeographic scope\\\\n[\\\\nedit\\\\n]\\\\nBRAC operates in 13 countries.\\\\nAsia:\\\\nBangladesh\\\\n,\\\\nAfghanistan\\\\n,\\\\nSri Lanka\\\\n,\\\\nPakistan\\\\n,\\\\nPhilippines\\\\n,\\\\nNepal\\\\n,\\\\nMyanmar\\\\nAfrica:\\\\nUganda\\\\n,\\\\nRwanda\\\\n,\\\\nTanzania\\\\n,\\\\nSouth Sudan\\\\n,\\\\nLiberia\\\\n,\\\\nSierra Leone\\\\nCaribbean:\\\\nHaiti\\\\nBRAC provides technical assistance to organisations in\\\\nHaiti\\\\n,\\\\nSudan\\\\n, and\\\\nIndonesia\\\\nBRAC has affiliate organisations in the United Kingdom and the United States\\\\nHonours and awards\\\\n[\\\\nedit\\\\n]\\\\nIndependence Award\\\\n, 2007\\\\n[\\\\n55\\\\n]\\\\n[\\\\n56\\\\n]\\\\nNumber one NGO in the world, 2019 by NGO Advisor.\\\\n[\\\\n57\\\\n]\\\\nNumber one NGO in the world, 2018\\\\n[\\\\n58\\\\n]\\\\nNumber one NGO in the world, 2017 by NGO Advisor\\\\n[\\\\n59\\\\n]\\\\nNumber one NGO in the world, 2016 by NGO Advisor\\\\n[\\\\n60\\\\n]\\\\nSee also\\\\n[\\\\nedit\\\\n]\\\\nASA (NGO)\\\\nGrameen Bank\\\\nBrac IT Services Limited\\\\nReferences\\\\n[\\\\nedit\\\\n]\\\\n^\\\\na\\\\nb\\\\n\\\\\"Bangladesh Annual Report\\\\\"\\\\n(PDF)\\\\n.\\\\nBRAC\\\\n.\\\\nArchived\\\\n(PDF)\\\\nfrom the original on 14 December 2017\\\\n.

Kamruzzaman\\\\n[\\\\n1\\\\n]\\\\nWebsite\\\\nbangladeshmuseum\\\\n.gov\\\\n.bd\\\\nThe Bangladesh National Museum is the national repository of Bangladesh\\'s cultural and historical artifacts, located in the Shahbag area of Dhaka. It was established on March 20, 1913, under the name Dhaka Museum, and was formally inaugurated on August 7, 1913. With an initial collection of 379 objects, it was opened to the public on August 25, 1914.\\\\n[\\\\n2\\\\n]\\\\nAfter the independence of Bangladesh in 1971, the institution was reorganized under the name Bangladesh National Museum, incorporating various parts of the former Dhaka Museum, and was formally inaugurated in its present form in 1983.\\\\n[\\\\n3\\\\n]\\\\nThe museum has departments of ethnography and decorative art, history and classical art, natural history, and world civilization. Artifacts from the prehistoric era to contemporary history are displayed here, which include over 50,000 ancient and medieval coins, Buddhist sculptures from the Gandhara period, and exhibitions related to the 1971 Liberation War.\\\\n[\\\\n4\\\\n]\\\\nThe idol of\\\\nRishabhdeva\\\\nin seated posture in display.\\\\nHistory\\\\n[\\\\nedit\\\\n]\\\\nBangladesh National Museum designed by\\\\nSyed Mainul Hossain\\\\nIn 1855, the Asiatic Society of Bengal proposed establishing a museum in Dhaka, but it was postponed due to logistical constraints. Later, in 1907, this initiative re-emerged among the elite class of Dhaka. Following this, on March 20, 1913, the Dhaka Museum was formally established by the government of undivided Bengal. It was initially located in a room of the old Secretariat building (later part of Dhaka Medical College Hospital). The institution was supported by subscriptions amounting to nearly 10,000 taka from the residents of Dhaka and an initial government grant of 2,000 taka. On August 7, 1913, the Lieutenant Governor of Bengal, Lord Thomas David Gibson Carmichael, inaugurated it for the public in the old building of Jagannath University College, in the presence of local dignitaries. The initial collection comprised about 500 items, primarily including regional archaeological artifacts, coins, manuscripts, and folk art.\\\\n[\\\\n5\\\\n]\\\\nAs the collection grew, it was relocated to the Nimtali Baroduari building by 1915.\\\\n[\\\\n6\\\\n]\\\\nAfter the partition of India in 1947, the institution continued to operate as the Dhaka Museum in East Pakistan and faced several administrative challenges. For example, following the death of its first curator, Nalini Kanta Bhattasali, there was no permanent curator from 1947 to 1951, and during this time, its premises were temporarily occupied by a press agency.\\\\n[\\\\n7\\\\n]\\\\nA part-time curator was appointed in 1951-1952, and in 1954, Enayetur Rahman joined as the curator. Exhibits from sites damaged by the attacks of the Pakistan Army in 1971 (such as the Dinajpur Rajbari and Baldha Museum) were transferred here. Additionally, the collection of war-related documents and artifacts began with the aim of documenting information about the Bengali liberation struggle.\\\\n[\\\\n8\\\\n]\\\\nAfter independence, in 1972, the institution was renamed \\'Bangladesh National Museum\\' in line with the identity of the newly independent state, and it officially received this name through a government order in 1974. A Trustee Board was formed in 1970 and a National Museum Commission in 1974 for its oversight. As part of the restructuring during the 1970s and 1980s, a new site for the museum in Shahbagh was approved by ECNEC in December 1975. Specialized curatorial departments, such as anthropology, decorative arts, and history, were established to manage the growing collection. Finally, on November 17, 1983, the new building in Shahbagh, equipped with modern facilities, was opened to the public.\\\\n[\\\\n9\\\\n]\\\\nBy 2017, as a result of ongoing acquisitions and research, the collection of the Bangladesh National Museum reached 91,287 artifacts, among which historical, ethnographic, and natural history items are particularly noteworthy.\\\\n[\\\\n10\\\\n]\\\\nAs part of a broader institutional modernization, the museum initiated a digitization project in 2012. Its objective was to create a database of the entire collection, improving access to and preservation of artifacts within the limited exhibition space.\\\\n[\\\\n11\\\\n]\\\\nIn April 2017, the museum launched a 360-degree virtual gallery, making selected exhibits accessible to a global audience through online tours.\\\\n[\\\\n12\\\\n]\\\\nFurthermore, since 2010, UNESCO has been collaborating with the institution on work related to intangible cultural heritage.\\\\n[\\\\n13\\\\n]\\\\nVisitors\\\\n[\\\\nedit\\\\n]\\\\nOn an average more than 2000 visitors come to visit the Bangladesh National Museum every day. Foreigners are also among them. Visitor fee is Tk 40 for adults and Tk 20 for minors, Tk 500 for foreigners and Tk 300 for visitors from SAARC countries.\\\\n[\\\\n14\\\\n]\\\\nHowever, tickets are not required for children below 3 years of age and physically challenged persons.\\\\nStructure\\\\n[\\\\nedit\\\\n]\\\\nThe categories of artifacts of the National Museum are:\\\\nHistory and Classical Art\\\\nEthnology and Decorative Arts\\\\nContemporary Art and World Civilization\\\\nDepartment of Natural History\\\\nConservation Laboratory\\\\nThere is also a public education department.\\\\nManagement structure\\\\n[\\\\nedit\\\\n]\\\\nBangladesh National Museum is an autonomous institution established by law and controlled by a board of trustees.

BRAC is the largest\\\\nnon-governmental development organisation\\\\nin the world, in terms of the number of employees, as of September 2016.\\\\n[\\\\n3\\\\n]\\\\n[\\\\n4\\\\n]\\\\n[\\\\n5\\\\n]\\\\nFounded by\\\\nSir Fazle Hasan Abed\\\\nin 1972, shortly after the\\\\nindependence of Bangladesh\\\\n, BRAC now operates in all 64\\\\ndistricts of Bangladesh\\\\nand in 16 other countries across Asia, Africa, and the Americas.\\\\n[\\\\n6\\\\n]\\\\nBRAC states that it employs over 90,000 people, roughly 70 percent of whom are women, and that it reaches more than 126 million people with its services.\\\\n[\\\\n7\\\\n]\\\\n[\\\\n8\\\\n]\\\\n[\\\\n9\\\\n]\\\\nBRAC has operations in 12 countries.\\\\n[\\\\n7\\\\n]\\\\n[\\\\n10\\\\n]\\\\nHistory\\\\n[\\\\nedit\\\\n]\\\\nSir Fazle Hasan Abed\\\\n, founder of BRAC\\\\nKnown formerly as the Bangladesh Rehabilitation Assistance Committee, then as the Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee, and later as Building Resources Across Communities,\\\\n[\\\\n11\\\\n]\\\\nBRAC was initiated in 1972 by\\\\nSir Fazle Hasan Abed\\\\nat\\\\nShallah Upazillah\\\\nin the district of\\\\nSunamganj\\\\nas a large scale relief and rehabilitation project to help returning war refugees after the\\\\nBangladesh Liberation War\\\\nof 1971.\\\\n[\\\\n12\\\\n]\\\\nUntil the mid-1970s, BRAC concentrated on community development through village development programmes that included agriculture, fisheries,\\\\ncooperatives\\\\n, rural crafts,\\\\nadult literacy\\\\n, health and family planning, vocational training for women, and the construction of community centres. A Research and Evaluation Division (RED) was set up to evaluate its activities and decide direction, and in 1977, BRAC began taking a more targeted approach by creating Village Organisations (VO) to assist the landless, small farmers, artisans, and vulnerable women. That same year, BRAC set up a commercial printing press to help finance its activities. The handicraft retail chain called\\\\nAarong\\\\nwas established the following year.\\\\n[\\\\n13\\\\n]\\\\nIn the late 1970s,\\\\ndiarrhoea\\\\nwas a leading cause of\\\\nchild mortality\\\\nin Bangladesh.\\\\n[\\\\n14\\\\n]\\\\nIn February 1979, BRAC began a field trial in two villages of what was then\\\\nSulla thana\\\\n, of a campaign to combat diarrhoea.\\\\n[\\\\n15\\\\n]\\\\nThe following year, they scaled up the operation and named it the Oral Therapy Extension Programme (OTEP).\\\\n[\\\\n16\\\\n]\\\\nIt taught rural mothers in their homes how to prepare an\\\\noral rehydration solution\\\\n(ORS) from readily available ingredients and how to use it to treat diarrhoea.\\\\n[\\\\n17\\\\n]\\\\nThe training was reinforced with posters and radio and TV spots.\\\\n[\\\\n18\\\\n]\\\\nThe ten-year programme taught 12 million households spread over 75,000 villages in every part of Bangladesh except the Chittagong Hill Tracts (which were unsafe to work in because of civil unrest).\\\\n[\\\\n19\\\\n]\\\\nFifteen years after they were taught, the vast majority of mothers could still prepare a safe and effective ORS.\\\\n[\\\\n20\\\\n]\\\\nThe treatment was little known in Bangladesh when OTEP began,\\\\n[\\\\n21\\\\n]\\\\nbut 15 years later it was used in rural households for severe diarrhoea more than 80% of the time, one of the highest rates in the world.\\\\n[\\\\n22\\\\n]\\\\nNon Formal Primary Education\\\\nwas started by BRAC in 1985.\\\\n[\\\\n23\\\\n]\\\\nIn 1979, BRAC started a Rural Development Programme (RDP).\\\\n[\\\\n24\\\\n]\\\\nThis was intended to give members access to credit and to savings facilities.\\\\n[\\\\n25\\\\n]\\\\nThe programme involved considerable growth in the number of people who were members of BRAC: in 1989, three years after the start of the Rural Development Programme, there were 350,000 members, and by 1995 there were 1.2 to 1.5 million members.\\\\n[\\\\n26\\\\n]\\\\nAn evaluation by the United Kingdom\\\\nDepartment for International Development\\\\nin 1998 found that the programme had been successful, though not all the aims were achieved.\\\\n[\\\\n25\\\\n]\\\\nBRAC\\'s own evaluation in 1996 found \\\\\"gradual improvements in the indicators such as wealth, revenue earning assets, the value of house structure, the level of cash earned, per capita expenditure on food, total household expenditure\\\\\", but hoped-for improvements in village self-management had not taken place, and the drop-out rate of members was high.\\\\n[\\\\n25\\\\n]\\\\nIn 1991, the Women\\'s Health Development programme commenced. The following year, BRAC established a Centre for Development Management (CDM) in\\\\nRajendrapur\\\\n.\\\\n[\\\\n27\\\\n]\\\\nBRAC opened an Information Technology Institute in 1999.\\\\n[\\\\n27\\\\n]\\\\nIn 2001, BRAC established a university in the city of Dhaka, Bangladesh, called\\\\nBRAC University\\\\n.\\\\n[\\\\n28\\\\n]\\\\nProgrammes\\\\n[\\\\nedit\\\\n]\\\\nBRAC has done what few others have \\\\u2013 they have achieved success on a massive scale, bringing life-saving health programs to millions of the world\\'s poorest people. They remind us that even the most intractable health problems are solvable, and inspire us to match their success throughout the developing world.\\\\nBill Gates\\\\n, Co-chair,\\\\nBill & Melinda Gates Foundation\\\\nGlobal Health Award, 2004\\\\nEconomic development\\\\n[\\\\nedit\\\\n]\\\\nMicrofinance, introduced in 1974, is BRAC\\'s oldest programme. It spans all districts of Bangladesh.\\\\n[\\\\n29\\\\n]\\\\n[\\\\n30\\\\n]\\\\nIt provides collateral-free loans to mostly poor, landless, rural women, enabling them to generate income and improve their\\\\nstandards of living\\\\n.\\\\n[\\\\n29\\\\n]\\\\n[\\\\n30\\\\n]\\\\nBRAC\\'s microfinance program is estimated to give out around the equivalent of one billion dollars a year in loans.\\\\n[\\\\n31\\\\n]\\\\nBRAC founded its retail outlet, Aarong (Bengali for \\\\\"village fair\\\\\") in 1978 to market and distribute products made by indigenous peoples. Aarong services about 65,000 artisans, and sells gold and silver jewellery, handloom, leather crafts, etc.\\\\n[\\\\n13\\\\n]\\\\nThe Challenging the Frontiers of Poverty Reduction: Targeting the Ultra Poor (CFPR-TUP) project was started in 2002.\\\\n[\\\\n32\\\\n]\\\\nThe ultra-poor are a group of people who eat below 80% of their energy requirements, despite spending at least 80% of their income on food.\\\\n[\\\\n33\\\\n]\\\\nIn Bangladesh, they constitute the poorest 17.5 per cent of the population.\\\\n[\\\\n34\\\\n]\\\\nThese people suffer from chronic hunger and malnutrition, have inadequate shelter, are more prone to disease, are deprived of education, and are more vulnerable to recurring natural disasters. The CFPR-TUP programme is aimed at households that are too poor to access the benefits from development interventions such as\\\\nmicrofinance\\\\nand assists them to access mainstream development services. The program costs around US$35 million a year.\\\\n[\\\\n35\\\\n]\\\\nSome sources have argued that microcredit programs in Bangladesh, including those implemented by BRAC, may have unintended negative consequences for Bangladeshi women\\'s economic status. Critics suggest that the financial assistance provided by BRAC might feed into the perception among local elites that women no longer require extra support. This perception may divert charitable giving\\'s toward direct funding of religious institutions instead of direct aid to the impoverished.\\\\n[\\\\n36\\\\n]\\\\nEducation\\\\n[\\\\nedit\\\\n]\\\\nBRAC is one of the largest NGOs involved in primary education in\\\\nBangladesh\\\\n.\\\\n[\\\\n37\\\\n]\\\\nSince 1974, BRAC\\'s primary education efforts were observable with their circulation of\\\\nGonokendra,\\\\nan educational children\\'s magazine, that BRAC sent to each of Bangladesh\\'s primary schools. Soon they were circulating 3,000 issues monthly. Sponsored by UNICEF, they were able to disseminate 50,000 copies to the country\\'s primary schools. BRAC continued developing education materials over the next few decades until, eventually, beginning to design their own primary and secondary school curriculum. In 1985, BRAC built 22 new one room schoolhouses, which constituted their \\\\\"Non-Formal Primary Education Program\\\\\" (NFPE). This was an effort to reduce illiteracy and truancy in Bangladeshi children, as well as address the education disparity between boys and girls.\\\\n[\\\\n38\\\\n]\\\\nIn 2018, BRAC educated over a million children have been educated worldwide.\\\\n[\\\\n39\\\\n]\\\\nIts schools constitute three-quarters of all NGO non-formal primary schools in the country.\\\\n[\\\\n37\\\\n]\\\\nBRAC\\'s education programme provides\\\\nnon-formal primary education\\\\nto those left out of the formal education system, especially poor, rural, or disadvantaged children, and drop-outs.\\\\n[\\\\n40\\\\n]\\\\nIts schools are typically one room with one teacher and no more than 33 students.  Core subjects include mathematics, social studies and English. The schools also offer extracurricular activities.\\\\n[\\\\n37\\\\n]\\\\nThey incentivise schooling by providing food, allowing flexible learning hours, and conferring scholarships contingent on academic performance.\\\\n[\\\\n41\\\\n]\\\\nBangladesh has reduced the gap between male and female attendance in schools.\\\\n[\\\\n41\\\\n]\\\\nThe improvement in female enrollment, which has largely been at the primary level, is in part attributable to BRAC.\\\\n[\\\\n37\\\\n]\\\\nRoughly 60% of the students in their schools are girls.\\\\n[\\\\n40\\\\n]\\\\nBRAC also runs a university called BRAC University, located in Dhaka, Bangladesh. BRAC University offers a liberal arts university education. The primary language for education at BRAC University is English. BRAC University is officially accredited by the University Grants Commission (UGC) and operates with the approval of the Ministry of Education in Bangladesh\\\\n[\\\\n42\\\\n]\\\\nPublic health\\\\n[\\\\nedit\\\\n]\\\\nBRAC started providing public healthcare in 1972 with an initial focus on\\\\ncurative care\\\\nthrough paramedics and a self-financing health insurance scheme. The programme went on to provide integrated healthcare services to around 30 million people.\\\\n[\\\\n27\\\\n]\\\\nA BRAC community health worker conducting a survey in the Korail slum, Bangladesh\\\\nBRAC\\'s 2007 impact assessment of its North West Microfinance Expansion Project testified to increased awareness of legal issues, including those of marriage and divorce, among women participants in BRAC programs. Furthermore, women participants\\' self-confidence was boosted, and the incidence of domestic violence was found to have declined.\\\\n[\\\\n43\\\\n]\\\\nOne of the most prominent forms of violence against women,\\\\nacid throwing\\\\n, has been decreasing by 15-20% annually since the enactment in 2002 of legislation specifically targeting acid violence.\\\\n[\\\\n44\\\\n]\\\\nDisaster relief\\\\n[\\\\nedit\\\\n]\\\\nBRAC responded to\\\\nCyclone Sidr\\\\n, which hit vast areas of the south-western coast of Bangladesh in mid-November 2007.\\\\n[\\\\n45\\\\n]\\\\nBRAC provided emergency relief to survivors, like clothing, food, safe drinking water, and medical care.\\\\n[\\\\n46\\\\n]\\\\nBRAC is now focusing on long-term rehabilitation, which will include agriculture support, infrastructure reconstruction and livelihood regeneration.\\\\n[\\\\n45\\\\n]\\\\nPartnership with the Nike Foundation\\\\n[\\\\nedit\\\\n]\\\\nBRAC has a collaboration with\\\\nNike\\\\n\\'s Girl Effect campaign to launch a new program to reach out to teenagers in\\\\nUganda\\\\nand\\\\nTanzania\\\\n.\\\\n[\\\\n47\\\\n]\\\\n[\\\\n48\\\\n]\\\\nFinances\\\\n[\\\\nedit\\\\n]\\\\nDonors\\\\n[\\\\nedit\\\\n]\\\\nIn 2006, BRAC received donations from the\\\\nDirectorate-General for International Cooperation\\\\n(DGIS) and the government of the Netherlands / Embassy of the Kingdom of the Netherlands (EKN).\\\\n[\\\\n49\\\\n]\\\\nThe\\\\nBill and Melinda Gates Foundation\\\\n(BMGF) is on the list of BRAC donors, and in 2020 it committed multiple emergency response grants to BRAC and BRAC USA, totaling around the equivalent of US$600,000\\\\n[\\\\n50\\\\n]\\\\n[\\\\n51\\\\n]\\\\nIn 2012, the\\\\nDepartment for International Development\\\\n(DFID), the government of the UK and\\\\nDepartment of Foreign Affairs and Trade\\\\n(DFAT), and the Australian government (SPA) (under the strategic partnership arrangement) became BRAC donors as well.\\\\n[\\\\n52\\\\n]\\\\nRevenue\\\\n[\\\\nedit\\\\n]\\\\nBRAC is partly self-funded through a number of social enterprises. These include a retail fashion chain called\\\\nAarong\\\\nthat sells rural handicrafts, an agricultural seed business, a dairy, and a cold storage facility, among others. Between 2011 and 2015, surplus self-generated revenue from the organization\\'s enterprises averaged $17 million annually.\\\\n[\\\\n53\\\\n]\\\\nHistorian\\\\nTaj Hashmi\\\\nhas criticized BRAC\\'s projects for exploiting the cheap labour of rural women and children.

Kamruzzaman\\\\n[\\\\n1\\\\n]\\\\nWebsite\\\\nbangladeshmuseum\\\\n.gov\\\\n.bd\\\\nThe Bangladesh National Museum is the national repository of Bangladesh\\'s cultural and historical artifacts, located in the Shahbag area of Dhaka. It was established on March 20, 1913, under the name Dhaka Museum, and was formally inaugurated on August 7, 1913. With an initial collection of 379 objects, it was opened to the public on August 25, 1914.\\\\n[\\\\n2\\\\n]\\\\nAfter the independence of Bangladesh in 1971, the institution was reorganized under the name Bangladesh National Museum, incorporating various parts of the former Dhaka Museum, and was formally inaugurated in its present form in 1983.\\\\n[\\\\n3\\\\n]\\\\nThe museum has departments of ethnography and decorative art, history and classical art, natural history, and world civilization. Artifacts from the prehistoric era to contemporary history are displayed here, which include over 50,000 ancient and medieval coins, Buddhist sculptures from the Gandhara period, and exhibitions related to the 1971 Liberation War.\\\\n[\\\\n4\\\\n]\\\\nThe idol of\\\\nRishabhdeva\\\\nin seated posture in display.\\\\nHistory\\\\n[\\\\nedit\\\\n]\\\\nBangladesh National Museum designed by\\\\nSyed Mainul Hossain\\\\nIn 1855, the Asiatic Society of Bengal proposed establishing a museum in Dhaka, but it was postponed due to logistical constraints. Later, in 1907, this initiative re-emerged among the elite class of Dhaka. Following this, on March 20, 1913, the Dhaka Museum was formally established by the government of undivided Bengal. It was initially located in a room of the old Secretariat building (later part of Dhaka Medical College Hospital). The institution was supported by subscriptions amounting to nearly 10,000 taka from the residents of Dhaka and an initial government grant of 2,000 taka. On August 7, 1913, the Lieutenant Governor of Bengal, Lord Thomas David Gibson Carmichael, inaugurated it for the public in the old building of Jagannath University College, in the presence of local dignitaries. The initial collection comprised about 500 items, primarily including regional archaeological artifacts, coins, manuscripts, and folk art.\\\\n[\\\\n5\\\\n]\\\\nAs the collection grew, it was relocated to the Nimtali Baroduari building by 1915.\\\\n[\\\\n6\\\\n]\\\\nAfter the partition of India in 1947, the institution continued to operate as the Dhaka Museum in East Pakistan and faced several administrative challenges. For example, following the death of its first curator, Nalini Kanta Bhattasali, there was no permanent curator from 1947 to 1951, and during this time, its premises were temporarily occupied by a press agency.\\\\n[\\\\n7\\\\n]\\\\nA part-time curator was appointed in 1951-1952, and in 1954, Enayetur Rahman joined as the curator. Exhibits from sites damaged by the attacks of the Pakistan Army in 1971 (such as the Dinajpur Rajbari and Baldha Museum) were transferred here. Additionally, the collection of war-related documents and artifacts began with the aim of documenting information about the Bengali liberation struggle.\\\\n[\\\\n8\\\\n]\\\\nAfter independence, in 1972, the institution was renamed \\'Bangladesh National Museum\\' in line with the identity of the newly independent state, and it officially received this name through a government order in 1974. A Trustee Board was formed in 1970 and a National Museum Commission in 1974 for its oversight. As part of the restructuring during the 1970s and 1980s, a new site for the museum in Shahbagh was approved by ECNEC in December 1975. Specialized curatorial departments, such as anthropology, decorative arts, and history, were established to manage the growing collection. Finally, on November 17, 1983, the new building in Shahbagh, equipped with modern facilities, was opened to the public.\\\\n[\\\\n9\\\\n]\\\\nBy 2017, as a result of ongoing acquisitions and research, the collection of the Bangladesh National Museum reached 91,287 artifacts, among which historical, ethnographic, and natural history items are particularly noteworthy.\\\\n[\\\\n10\\\\n]\\\\nAs part of a broader institutional modernization, the museum initiated a digitization project in 2012. Its objective was to create a database of the entire collection, improving access to and preservation of artifacts within the limited exhibition space.\\\\n[\\\\n11\\\\n]\\\\nIn April 2017, the museum launched a 360-degree virtual gallery, making selected exhibits accessible to a global audience through online tours.\\\\n[\\\\n12\\\\n]\\\\nFurthermore, since 2010, UNESCO has been collaborating with the institution on work related to intangible cultural heritage.\\\\n[\\\\n13\\\\n]\\\\nVisitors\\\\n[\\\\nedit\\\\n]\\\\nOn an average more than 2000 visitors come to visit the Bangladesh National Museum every day. Foreigners are also among them. Visitor fee is Tk 40 for adults and Tk 20 for minors, Tk 500 for foreigners and Tk 300 for visitors from SAARC countries.\\\\n[\\\\n14\\\\n]\\\\nHowever, tickets are not required for children below 3 years of age and physically challenged persons.\\\\nStructure\\\\n[\\\\nedit\\\\n]\\\\nThe categories of artifacts of the National Museum are:\\\\nHistory and Classical Art\\\\nEthnology and Decorative Arts\\\\nContemporary Art and World Civilization\\\\nDepartment of Natural History\\\\nConservation Laboratory\\\\nThere is also a public education department.\\\\nManagement structure\\\\n[\\\\nedit\\\\n]\\\\nBangladesh National Museum is an autonomous institution established by law and controlled by a board of trustees.

A Research and Evaluation Division (RED) was set up to evaluate its activities and decide direction, and in 1977, BRAC began taking a more targeted approach by creating Village Organisations (VO) to assist the landless, small farmers, artisans, and vulnerable women. That same year, BRAC set up a commercial printing press to help finance its activities. The handicraft retail chain called\\\\nAarong\\\\nwas established the following year.\\\\n[\\\\n13\\\\n]\\\\nIn the late 1970s,\\\\ndiarrhoea\\\\nwas a leading cause of\\\\nchild mortality\\\\nin Bangladesh.\\\\n[\\\\n14\\\\n]\\\\nIn February 1979, BRAC began a field trial in two villages of what was then\\\\nSulla thana\\\\n, of a campaign to combat diarrhoea.\\\\n[\\\\n15\\\\n]\\\\nThe following year, they scaled up the operation and named it the Oral Therapy Extension Programme (OTEP).\\\\n[\\\\n16\\\\n]\\\\nIt taught rural mothers in their homes how to prepare an\\\\noral rehydration solution\\\\n(ORS) from readily available ingredients and how to use it to treat diarrhoea.\\\\n[\\\\n17\\\\n]\\\\nThe training was reinforced with posters and radio and TV spots.\\\\n[\\\\n18\\\\n]\\\\nThe ten-year programme taught 12 million households spread over 75,000 villages in every part of Bangladesh except the Chittagong Hill Tracts (which were unsafe to work in because of civil unrest).\\\\n[\\\\n19\\\\n]\\\\nFifteen years after they were taught, the vast majority of mothers could still prepare a safe and effective ORS.\\\\n[\\\\n20\\\\n]\\\\nThe treatment was little known in Bangladesh when OTEP began,\\\\n[\\\\n21\\\\n]\\\\nbut 15 years later it was used in rural households for severe diarrhoea more than 80% of the time, one of the highest rates in the world.\\\\n[\\\\n22\\\\n]\\\\nNon Formal Primary Education\\\\nwas started by BRAC in 1985.\\\\n[\\\\n23\\\\n]\\\\nIn 1979, BRAC started a Rural Development Programme (RDP).\\\\n[\\\\n24\\\\n]\\\\nThis was intended to give members access to credit and to savings facilities.\\\\n[\\\\n25\\\\n]\\\\nThe programme involved considerable growth in the number of people who were members of BRAC: in 1989, three years after the start of the Rural Development Programme, there were 350,000 members, and by 1995 there were 1.2 to 1.5 million members.\\\\n[\\\\n26\\\\n]\\\\nAn evaluation by the United Kingdom\\\\nDepartment for International Development\\\\nin 1998 found that the programme had been successful, though not all the aims were achieved.\\\\n[\\\\n25\\\\n]\\\\nBRAC\\'s own evaluation in 1996 found \\\\\"gradual improvements in the indicators such as wealth, revenue earning assets, the value of house structure, the level of cash earned, per capita expenditure on food, total household expenditure\\\\\", but hoped-for improvements in village self-management had not taken place, and the drop-out rate of members was high.\\\\n[\\\\n25\\\\n]\\\\nIn 1991, the Women\\'s Health Development programme commenced. The following year, BRAC established a Centre for Development Management (CDM) in\\\\nRajendrapur\\\\n.\\\\n[\\\\n27\\\\n]\\\\nBRAC opened an Information Technology Institute in 1999.\\\\n[\\\\n27\\\\n]\\\\nIn 2001, BRAC established a university in the city of Dhaka, Bangladesh, called\\\\nBRAC University\\\\n.\\\\n[\\\\n28\\\\n]\\\\nProgrammes\\\\n[\\\\nedit\\\\n]\\\\nBRAC has done what few others have \\\\u2013 they have achieved success on a massive scale, bringing life-saving health programs to millions of the world\\'s poorest people. They remind us that even the most intractable health problems are solvable, and inspire us to match their success throughout the developing world.\\\\nBill Gates\\\\n, Co-chair,\\\\nBill & Melinda Gates Foundation\\\\nGlobal Health Award, 2004\\\\nEconomic development\\\\n[\\\\nedit\\\\n]\\\\nMicrofinance, introduced in 1974, is BRAC\\'s oldest programme. It spans all districts of Bangladesh.\\\\n[\\\\n29\\\\n]\\\\n[\\\\n30\\\\n]\\\\nIt provides collateral-free loans to mostly poor, landless, rural women, enabling them to generate income and improve their\\\\nstandards of living\\\\n.\\\\n[\\\\n29\\\\n]\\\\n[\\\\n30\\\\n]\\\\nBRAC\\'s microfinance program is estimated to give out around the equivalent of one billion dollars a year in loans.\\\\n[\\\\n31\\\\n]\\\\nBRAC founded its retail outlet, Aarong (Bengali for \\\\\"village fair\\\\\") in 1978 to market and distribute products made by indigenous peoples. Aarong services about 65,000 artisans, and sells gold and silver jewellery, handloom, leather crafts, etc.\\\\n[\\\\n13\\\\n]\\\\nThe Challenging the Frontiers of Poverty Reduction: Targeting the Ultra Poor (CFPR-TUP) project was started in 2002.\\\\n[\\\\n32\\\\n]\\\\nThe ultra-poor are a group of people who eat below 80% of their energy requirements, despite spending at least 80% of their income on food.\\\\n[\\\\n33\\\\n]\\\\nIn Bangladesh, they constitute the poorest 17.5 per cent of the population.\\\\n[\\\\n34\\\\n]\\\\nThese people suffer from chronic hunger and malnutrition, have inadequate shelter, are more prone to disease, are deprived of education, and are more vulnerable to recurring natural disasters. The CFPR-TUP programme is aimed at households that are too poor to access the benefits from development interventions such as\\\\nmicrofinance\\\\nand assists them to access mainstream development services. The program costs around US$35 million a year.\\\\n[\\\\n35\\\\n]\\\\nSome sources have argued that microcredit programs in Bangladesh, including those implemented by BRAC, may have unintended negative consequences for Bangladeshi women\\'s economic status. Critics suggest that the financial assistance provided by BRAC might feed into the perception among local elites that women no longer require extra support. This perception may divert charitable giving\\'s toward direct funding of religious institutions instead of direct aid to the impoverished.\\\\n[\\\\n36\\\\n]\\\\nEducation\\\\n[\\\\nedit\\\\n]\\\\nBRAC is one of the largest NGOs involved in primary education in\\\\nBangladesh\\\\n.\\\\n[\\\\n37\\\\n]\\\\nSince 1974, BRAC\\'s primary education efforts were observable with their circulation of\\\\nGonokendra,\\\\nan educational children\\'s magazine, that BRAC sent to each of Bangladesh\\'s primary schools. Soon they were circulating 3,000 issues monthly. Sponsored by UNICEF, they were able to disseminate 50,000 copies to the country\\'s primary schools. BRAC continued developing education materials over the next few decades until, eventually, beginning to design their own primary and secondary school curriculum. In 1985, BRAC built 22 new one room schoolhouses, which constituted their \\\\\"Non-Formal Primary Education Program\\\\\" (NFPE). This was an effort to reduce illiteracy and truancy in Bangladeshi children, as well as address the education disparity between boys and girls.\\\\n[\\\\n38\\\\n]\\\\nIn 2018, BRAC educated over a million children have been educated worldwide.\\\\n[\\\\n39\\\\n]\\\\nIts schools constitute three-quarters of all NGO non-formal primary schools in the country.\\\\n[\\\\n37\\\\n]\\\\nBRAC\\'s education programme provides\\\\nnon-formal primary education\\\\nto those left out of the formal education system, especially poor, rural, or disadvantaged children, and drop-outs.\\\\n[\\\\n40\\\\n]\\\\nIts schools are typically one room with one teacher and no more than 33 students.  Core subjects include mathematics, social studies and English. The schools also offer extracurricular activities.\\\\n[\\\\n37\\\\n]\\\\nThey incentivise schooling by providing food, allowing flexible learning hours, and conferring scholarships contingent on academic performance.\\\\n[\\\\n41\\\\n]\\\\nBangladesh has reduced the gap between male and female attendance in schools.\\\\n[\\\\n41\\\\n]\\\\nThe improvement in female enrollment, which has largely been at the primary level, is in part attributable to BRAC.\\\\n[\\\\n37\\\\n]\\\\nRoughly 60% of the students in their schools are girls.\\\\n[\\\\n40\\\\n]\\\\nBRAC also runs a university called BRAC University, located in Dhaka, Bangladesh. BRAC University offers a liberal arts university education. The primary language for education at BRAC University is English. BRAC University is officially accredited by the University Grants Commission (UGC) and operates with the approval of the Ministry of Education in Bangladesh\\\\n[\\\\n42\\\\n]\\\\nPublic health\\\\n[\\\\nedit\\\\n]\\\\nBRAC started providing public healthcare in 1972 with an initial focus on\\\\ncurative care\\\\nthrough paramedics and a self-financing health insurance scheme. The programme went on to provide integrated healthcare services to around 30 million people.\\\\n[\\\\n27\\\\n]\\\\nA BRAC community health worker conducting a survey in the Korail slum, Bangladesh\\\\nBRAC\\'s 2007 impact assessment of its North West Microfinance Expansion Project testified to increased awareness of legal issues, including those of marriage and divorce, among women participants in BRAC programs. Furthermore, women participants\\' self-confidence was boosted, and the incidence of domestic violence was found to have declined.\\\\n[\\\\n43\\\\n]\\\\nOne of the most prominent forms of violence against women,\\\\nacid throwing\\\\n, has been decreasing by 15-20% annually since the enactment in 2002 of legislation specifically targeting acid violence.\\\\n[\\\\n44\\\\n]\\\\nDisaster relief\\\\n[\\\\nedit\\\\n]\\\\nBRAC responded to\\\\nCyclone Sidr\\\\n, which hit vast areas of the south-western coast of Bangladesh in mid-November 2007.\\\\n[\\\\n45\\\\n]\\\\nBRAC provided emergency relief to survivors, like clothing, food, safe drinking water, and medical care.\\\\n[\\\\n46\\\\n]\\\\nBRAC is now focusing on long-term rehabilitation, which will include agriculture support, infrastructure reconstruction and livelihood regeneration.\\\\n[\\\\n45\\\\n]\\\\nPartnership with the Nike Foundation\\\\n[\\\\nedit\\\\n]\\\\nBRAC has a collaboration with\\\\nNike\\\\n\\'s Girl Effect campaign to launch a new program to reach out to teenagers in\\\\nUganda\\\\nand\\\\nTanzania\\\\n.\\\\n[\\\\n47\\\\n]\\\\n[\\\\n48\\\\n]\\\\nFinances\\\\n[\\\\nedit\\\\n]\\\\nDonors\\\\n[\\\\nedit\\\\n]\\\\nIn 2006, BRAC received donations from the\\\\nDirectorate-General for International Cooperation\\\\n(DGIS) and the government of the Netherlands / Embassy of the Kingdom of the Netherlands (EKN).\\\\n[\\\\n49\\\\n]\\\\nThe\\\\nBill and Melinda Gates Foundation\\\\n(BMGF) is on the list of BRAC donors, and in 2020 it committed multiple emergency response grants to BRAC and BRAC USA, totaling around the equivalent of US$600,000\\\\n[\\\\n50\\\\n]\\\\n[\\\\n51\\\\n]\\\\nIn 2012, the\\\\nDepartment for International Development\\\\n(DFID), the government of the UK and\\\\nDepartment of Foreign Affairs and Trade\\\\n(DFAT), and the Australian government (SPA) (under the strategic partnership arrangement) became BRAC donors as well.\\\\n[\\\\n52\\\\n]\\\\nRevenue\\\\n[\\\\nedit\\\\n]\\\\nBRAC is partly self-funded through a number of social enterprises.

Kamruzzaman\\\\n[\\\\n1\\\\n]\\\\nWebsite\\\\nbangladeshmuseum\\\\n.gov\\\\n.bd\\\\nThe Bangladesh National Museum is the national repository of Bangladesh\\'s cultural and historical artifacts, located in the Shahbag area of Dhaka. It was established on March 20, 1913, under the name Dhaka Museum, and was formally inaugurated on August 7, 1913. With an initial collection of 379 objects, it was opened to the public on August 25, 1914.\\\\n[\\\\n2\\\\n]\\\\nAfter the independence of Bangladesh in 1971, the institution was reorganized under the name Bangladesh National Museum, incorporating various parts of the former Dhaka Museum, and was formally inaugurated in its present form in 1983.\\\\n[\\\\n3\\\\n]\\\\nThe museum has departments of ethnography and decorative art, history and classical art, natural history, and world civilization. Artifacts from the prehistoric era to contemporary history are displayed here, which include over 50,000 ancient and medieval coins, Buddhist sculptures from the Gandhara period, and exhibitions related to the 1971 Liberation War.\\\\n[\\\\n4\\\\n]\\\\nThe idol of\\\\nRishabhdeva\\\\nin seated posture in display.\\\\nHistory\\\\n[\\\\nedit\\\\n]\\\\nBangladesh National Museum designed by\\\\nSyed Mainul Hossain\\\\nIn 1855, the Asiatic Society of Bengal proposed establishing a museum in Dhaka, but it was postponed due to logistical constraints. Later, in 1907, this initiative re-emerged among the elite class of Dhaka. Following this, on March 20, 1913, the Dhaka Museum was formally established by the government of undivided Bengal. It was initially located in a room of the old Secretariat building (later part of Dhaka Medical College Hospital). The institution was supported by subscriptions amounting to nearly 10,000 taka from the residents of Dhaka and an initial government grant of 2,000 taka. On August 7, 1913, the Lieutenant Governor of Bengal, Lord Thomas David Gibson Carmichael, inaugurated it for the public in the old building of Jagannath University College, in the presence of local dignitaries. The initial collection comprised about 500 items, primarily including regional archaeological artifacts, coins, manuscripts, and folk art.\\\\n[\\\\n5\\\\n]\\\\nAs the collection grew, it was relocated to the Nimtali Baroduari building by 1915.\\\\n[\\\\n6\\\\n]\\\\nAfter the partition of India in 1947, the institution continued to operate as the Dhaka Museum in East Pakistan and faced several administrative challenges. For example, following the death of its first curator, Nalini Kanta Bhattasali, there was no permanent curator from 1947 to 1951, and during this time, its premises were temporarily occupied by a press agency.\\\\n[\\\\n7\\\\n]\\\\nA part-time curator was appointed in 1951-1952, and in 1954, Enayetur Rahman joined as the curator. Exhibits from sites damaged by the attacks of the Pakistan Army in 1971 (such as the Dinajpur Rajbari and Baldha Museum) were transferred here. Additionally, the collection of war-related documents and artifacts began with the aim of documenting information about the Bengali liberation struggle.\\\\n[\\\\n8\\\\n]\\\\nAfter independence, in 1972, the institution was renamed \\'Bangladesh National Museum\\' in line with the identity of the newly independent state, and it officially received this name through a government order in 1974. A Trustee Board was formed in 1970 and a National Museum Commission in 1974 for its oversight. As part of the restructuring during the 1970s and 1980s, a new site for the museum in Shahbagh was approved by ECNEC in December 1975. Specialized curatorial departments, such as anthropology, decorative arts, and history, were established to manage the growing collection. Finally, on November 17, 1983, the new building in Shahbagh, equipped with modern facilities, was opened to the public.\\\\n[\\\\n9\\\\n]\\\\nBy 2017, as a result of ongoing acquisitions and research, the collection of the Bangladesh National Museum reached 91,287 artifacts, among which historical, ethnographic, and natural history items are particularly noteworthy.\\\\n[\\\\n10\\\\n]\\\\nAs part of a broader institutional modernization, the museum initiated a digitization project in 2012. Its objective was to create a database of the entire collection, improving access to and preservation of artifacts within the limited exhibition space.\\\\n[\\\\n11\\\\n]\\\\nIn April 2017, the museum launched a 360-degree virtual gallery, making selected exhibits accessible to a global audience through online tours.\\\\n[\\\\n12\\\\n]\\\\nFurthermore, since 2010, UNESCO has been collaborating with the institution on work related to intangible cultural heritage.\\\\n[\\\\n13\\\\n]\\\\nVisitors\\\\n[\\\\nedit\\\\n]\\\\nOn an average more than 2000 visitors come to visit the Bangladesh National Museum every day. Foreigners are also among them. Visitor fee is Tk 40 for adults and Tk 20 for minors, Tk 500 for foreigners and Tk 300 for visitors from SAARC countries.\\\\n[\\\\n14\\\\n]\\\\nHowever, tickets are not required for children below 3 years of age and physically challenged persons.\\\\nStructure\\\\n[\\\\nedit\\\\n]\\\\nThe categories of artifacts of the National Museum are:\\\\nHistory and Classical Art\\\\nEthnology and Decorative Arts\\\\nContemporary Art and World Civilization\\\\nDepartment of Natural History\\\\nConservation Laboratory\\\\nThere is also a public education department.\\\\nManagement structure\\\\n[\\\\nedit\\\\n]\\\\nBangladesh National Museum is an autonomous institution established by law and controlled by a board of trustees.

She revealed in a post-match interview that the coordinates (\\\\n26 28 0.75\\\\\" N 80 5\\' 1.4\\\\\" W)\\\\npointed to public tennis courts in\\\\nDelray Beach\\\\nwhere she grew up and trained.\\\\n[\\\\n158\\\\n]\\\\nIn 2025, Gauff became the face of a collaboration between\\\\nMiu Miu\\\\nand New Balance, blending luxury fashion with performance wear in a campaign that highlighted her crossover appeal.\\\\n[\\\\n159\\\\n]\\\\nPersonal life\\\\n[\\\\nedit\\\\n]\\\\nGauff in 2022\\\\nGauff is a\\\\nChristian\\\\n. Since she was eight years old, she has prayed with her father before every match that she and her opponent would be safe. After winning the Cincinnati Open in August 2023, she said: \\\\\"... I\\'d like to thank my Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. I spent a lot of nights alone, crying trying to figure it out. I still have a lot to figure out, but I thank Him for covering me.\\\\\" After winning her first major title in September 2023, she said: \\\\\"... I don\\'t pray for results, I just ask that I get the strength to give it my all and whatever happens happens. I\\'m so blessed in this life.\\\\\"\\\\n[\\\\n160\\\\n]\\\\nGauff\\'s tennis idols are Serena and Venus Williams. \\\\\"Serena Williams has always been my idol...and Venus,\\\\\" she has said. \\\\\"They are the reason why I wanted to pick up a tennis racquet.\\\\\"\\\\n[\\\\n16\\\\n]\\\\nGauff first met Serena when she won the Little Mo national tournament at the age of eight, and later met her again to film a commercial for\\\\nDelta Air Lines\\\\nand at the Mouratoglou Academy.\\\\n[\\\\n13\\\\n]\\\\nAfter defeating Venus Williams at Wimbledon in 2019, Gauff expressed her respect when they shook hands at the net. \\\\\"I was just telling her thank you for everything she\\'s done for the sport,\\\\\" Gauff said. \\\\\"She\\'s been an inspiration for many people. I was just really telling her thank you.\\\\\"\\\\n[\\\\n38\\\\n]\\\\nGauff stated in 2020 that she had experienced\\\\ndepression\\\\nand stress related to her sporting career, though her parents clarified that she was not diagnosed with depression in the clinical sense, and had not sought medical attention relating to her psychological well-being.\\\\n[\\\\n161\\\\n]\\\\nGauff is a fan of\\\\nanime\\\\n, including\\\\nMy Hero Academia\\\\n.\\\\n[\\\\n162\\\\n]\\\\nGauff is a huge fan of popular YouTubers and streamers\\\\nLudwig Ahgren\\\\n, Valkyrae & Kai Cenat.\\\\n[\\\\n163\\\\n]\\\\nIn July 2023, Gauff and actress\\\\nStorm Reid\\\\nhelped fund a new playground and purple-painted tennis courts in East Atlanta\\'s\\\\nBrownwood Park\\\\n.\\\\n[\\\\n164\\\\n]\\\\nCareer statistics\\\\n[\\\\nedit\\\\n]\\\\nMain article:\\\\nCoco Gauff career statistics\\\\nGrand Slam tournament performance timelines\\\\n[\\\\nedit\\\\n]\\\\nKey\\\\nW\\\\nF\\\\nSF\\\\nQF\\\\n#R\\\\nRR\\\\nQ#\\\\nDNQ\\\\nA\\\\nNH\\\\n(W) winner; (F) finalist; (SF) semifinalist; (QF) quarterfinalist; (#R) rounds 4, 3, 2, 1; (RR) round-robin stage; (Q#) qualification round; (DNQ) did not qualify; (A) absent;  (NH) not held; (SR) strike rate (events won / competed); (W\\\\u2013L) win\\\\u2013loss record.\\\\nTo avoid confusion and double counting, these charts are updated at the conclusion of a tournament or when the player\\'s participation has ended.\\\\nSingles\\\\n[\\\\nedit\\\\n]\\\\nTournament\\\\n2019\\\\n2020\\\\n2021\\\\n2022\\\\n2023\\\\n2024\\\\n2025\\\\nSR\\\\nW\\\\u2013L\\\\nWin\\\\u00a0%\\\\nAustralian Open\\\\nA\\\\n4R\\\\n2R\\\\n1R\\\\n4R\\\\nSF\\\\nQF\\\\n0 / 6\\\\n16\\\\u20136\\\\n73%\\\\nFrench Open\\\\nQ2\\\\n2R\\\\nQF\\\\nF\\\\nQF\\\\nSF\\\\nW\\\\n1 / 6\\\\n27\\\\u20135\\\\n84%\\\\nWimbledon\\\\n4R\\\\nNH\\\\n4R\\\\n3R\\\\n1R\\\\n4R\\\\n1R\\\\n0 / 6\\\\n11\\\\u20136\\\\n65%\\\\nUS Open\\\\n3R\\\\n1R\\\\n2R\\\\nQF\\\\nW\\\\n4R\\\\n4R\\\\n1 / 7\\\\n20\\\\u20136\\\\n77%\\\\nWin\\\\u2013loss\\\\n5\\\\u20132\\\\n4\\\\u20133\\\\n9\\\\u20134\\\\n12\\\\u20134\\\\n14\\\\u20133\\\\n16\\\\u20134\\\\n14\\\\u20133\\\\n2 / 25\\\\n74\\\\u201323\\\\n76%\\\\nDoubles\\\\n[\\\\nedit\\\\n]\\\\nTournament\\\\n2019\\\\n2020\\\\n2021\\\\n2022\\\\n2023\\\\n2024\\\\n2025\\\\nSR\\\\nW\\\\u2013L\\\\nWin\\\\u00a0%\\\\nAustralian Open\\\\nA\\\\nQF\\\\nQF\\\\n1R\\\\nSF\\\\nA\\\\nA\\\\n0 / 4\\\\n10\\\\u20134\\\\n71%\\\\nFrench Open\\\\n1R\\\\n3R\\\\n1R\\\\nF\\\\nSF\\\\nW\\\\nA\\\\n1 / 6\\\\n17\\\\u20135\\\\n77%\\\\nWimbledon\\\\nA\\\\nNH\\\\n3R\\\\nA\\\\n3R\\\\nQF\\\\nA\\\\n0 / 3\\\\n7\\\\u20133\\\\n70%\\\\nUS Open\\\\n3R\\\\n2R\\\\nF\\\\n1R\\\\nQF\\\\nA\\\\n0 / 5\\\\n11\\\\u20135\\\\n69%\\\\nWin\\\\u2013loss\\\\n2\\\\u20132\\\\n6\\\\u20133\\\\n10\\\\u20134\\\\n5\\\\u20133\\\\n13\\\\u20134\\\\n9\\\\u20131\\\\n0\\\\u20130\\\\n1 / 18\\\\n45\\\\u201317\\\\n73%\\\\nGrand Slam tournaments\\\\n[\\\\nedit\\\\n]\\\\nSingles: 3 (2 titles, 1 runner-up)\\\\n[\\\\nedit\\\\n]\\\\nResult\\\\nYear\\\\nTournament\\\\nSurface\\\\nOpponent\\\\nScore\\\\nLoss\\\\n2022\\\\nFrench Open\\\\nClay\\\\nIga \\\\u015awi\\\\u0105tek\\\\n1\\\\u20136, 3\\\\u20136\\\\nWin\\\\n2023\\\\nUS Open\\\\nHard\\\\nAryna Sabalenka\\\\n2\\\\u20136, 6\\\\u20133, 6\\\\u20132\\\\nWin\\\\n2025\\\\nFrench Open\\\\nClay\\\\nAryna Sabalenka\\\\n6\\\\u20137\\\\n(5\\\\u20137)\\\\n, 6\\\\u20132, 6\\\\u20134\\\\nDoubles: 3 (1 title, 2 runner-ups)\\\\n[\\\\nedit\\\\n]\\\\nResult\\\\nYear\\\\nTournament\\\\nSurface\\\\nPartner\\\\nOpponents\\\\nScore\\\\nLoss\\\\n2021\\\\nUS Open\\\\nHard\\\\nCaty McNally\\\\nSamantha Stosur\\\\nZhang Shuai\\\\n3\\\\u20136, 6\\\\u20133, 3\\\\u20136\\\\nLoss\\\\n2022\\\\nFrench Open\\\\nClay\\\\nJessica Pegula\\\\nCaroline Garcia\\\\nKristina Mladenovic\\\\n6\\\\u20132, 3\\\\u20136, 2\\\\u20136\\\\nWin\\\\n2024\\\\nFrench Open\\\\nClay\\\\nKate\\\\u0159ina Siniakov\\\\u00e1\\\\nSara Errani\\\\nJasmine Paolini\\\\n7\\\\u20136\\\\n(7\\\\u20135)\\\\n, 6\\\\u20133\\\\nYear-end championships (WTA Finals)\\\\n[\\\\nedit\\\\n]\\\\nSingles: 1 (title)\\\\n[\\\\nedit\\\\n]\\\\nResult\\\\nYear\\\\nTournament\\\\nSurface\\\\nOpponent\\\\nScore\\\\nWin\\\\n2024\\\\nWTA Finals\\\\n, Saudi Arabia\\\\nHard (i)\\\\nZheng Qinwen\\\\n3\\\\u20136, 6\\\\u20134, 7\\\\u20136\\\\n(7\\\\u20132)\\\\nReferences\\\\n[\\\\nedit\\\\n]\\\\n^\\\\n\\\\\"Career Prize Money Leaders\\\\\"\\\\n(PDF)\\\\n.\\\\nArchived\\\\n(PDF)\\\\nfrom the original on February 26, 2020\\\\n.

Initially, it offered only a degree in mechanical engineering. By 1901, its curriculum had expanded to include electrical, civil, and chemical engineering. In 1948, the school changed its name to reflect its evolution from a\\ntrade school\\nto a\\ntechnical institute\\nand\\nresearch university\\n.

Two former\\nConfederate\\nofficers, Major\\nJohn Fletcher Hanson\\n(an industrialist) and\\nNathaniel Edwin Harris\\n(a politician and eventually Governor of Georgia), who had become prominent citizens in the town of\\nMacon, Georgia\\n, after the\\nCivil War\\n, believed that the South needed to improve its technology to compete with the North's\\nindustrialization\\n.\\n[\\n16\\n]\\n[\\n17\\n]\\nBecause the American South of that era was mainly populated by agricultural workers and few technical developments were occurring, they proposed to establish a technology school.\\n[\\n16\\n]\\n[\\n17\\n]\\nIn 1882, the\\nGeorgia State Legislature\\nauthorized a committee, led by Harris, to visit the Northeast to learn how technology schools worked. They were impressed by the polytechnic educational models developed at the\\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\\nand the Worcester County Free Institute of Industrial Science (now\\nWorcester Polytechnic Institute\\n). The committee recommended adapting the Worcester model, which stressed a combination of \\\"theory and practice\\\", the \\\"practice\\\" component including student employment and production of consumer items to generate revenue for the school.\\n[\\n18\\n]\\nOn October 13, 1885,\\nGeorgia Governor\\nHenry D. McDaniel\\nsigned the bill to create and fund the new school.\\n[\\n1\\n]\\nIn 1887, Atlanta pioneer\\nRichard Peters\\ndonated to the state 4 acres (1.6\\u00a0ha) of the site of a failed garden suburb called\\nPeters Park\\n. The site was bounded on the south by\\nNorth Avenue\\n, and on the west by Cherry Street.\\n[\\n1\\n]\\nHe then sold five adjoining acres of land to the state for\\nUS$\\n10,000, (equivalent to $350,000 in 2024).\\n[\\n1\\n]\\nThis land was near Atlanta's northern city limits at the time of its founding, although the city has since expanded several miles beyond it. A historical marker on the large hill in\\nCentral Campus\\nsays that the site occupied by the school's first buildings once held fortifications to protect Atlanta during the\\nAtlanta campaign\\nof the American Civil War.\\n[\\n19\\n]\\nThe surrender of the city took place in 1864 on what is today the southwestern boundary of the Georgia Tech campus.\\n[\\n20\\n]\\nEarly years\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nAn early picture of Georgia Tech, circa 1899\\nThe Georgia School of Technology opened in the fall of 1888 with two buildings.\\n[\\n16\\n]\\nOne building (now\\nTech Tower\\n, an administrative headquarters) had classrooms to teach students; The second building featured a shop and had a\\nfoundry\\n,\\nforge\\n,\\nboiler room\\n, and engine room. It was designed for students to work and produce goods to sell and fund the school. The two buildings were equal in size to show the importance of teaching both the mind and the hands, though, at the time, there was some disagreement to whether the machine shop should have been used to turn a profit.\\n[\\n16\\n]\\n[\\n18\\n]\\nOn October 20, 1905,\\nU.S. President\\nTheodore Roosevelt\\nvisited Georgia Tech. On the steps of Tech Tower, Roosevelt delivered a speech about the importance of technological education.\\n[\\n21\\n]\\nHe then shook hands with every student.\\n[\\n22\\n]\\nGeorgia Tech's Evening School of Commerce began holding classes in 1912.\\n[\\n23\\n]\\nThe evening school admitted its first female student in 1917, although the state legislature did not officially authorize attendance by women until 1920.\\n[\\n23\\n]\\n[\\n24\\n]\\nAnnie T. Wise became the first female graduate in 1919 and was Georgia Tech's first female faculty member the following year.\\n[\\n23\\n]\\n[\\n24\\n]\\nIn 1931, the\\nBoard of Regents\\ntransferred control of the Evening School of Commerce to the\\nUniversity of Georgia\\n(UGA) and moved the civil and electrical engineering courses at UGA to Tech.\\n[\\n23\\n]\\n[\\n24\\n]\\nTech replaced the commerce school with what later became the\\nCollege of Business\\n. The commerce school would later split from UGA and eventually become\\nGeorgia State University\\n.\\n[\\n23\\n]\\n[\\n25\\n]\\nIn 1934, the Engineering Experiment Station (later known as the\\nGeorgia Tech Research Institute\\n) was founded by\\nW. Harry Vaughan\\nwith an initial budget of $5,000 (equivalent to $117,525 in 2024) and 13 part-time faculty.\\n[\\n26\\n]\\n[\\n27\\n]\\nIn the mid to late 40s, President Blake Van Leer had a focus on making Georgia Tech the \\\"\\nMIT\\nof the South.\\\"\\n[\\n28\\n]\\nVan Leer lobbied government and business for funds for new facilities.

Some are well-known; for example, the most notable of these is the popular but rare tradition of stealing the 'T' from Tech Tower. Tech Tower, Tech's historic primary administrative building, has the letters \\\"TECH\\\" hanging atop it on each of its four sides. There have been several attempts by students to orchestrate complex plans to steal the huge symbolic letter T, and on occasion they have carried this act out successfully.\\nSchool colors\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nGeorgia Tech students hold a heated, long and ongoing rivalry with the University of Georgia, known as Clean, Old-Fashioned Hate. The first known hostilities between the two institutions trace back to 1891. The University of Georgia's literary magazine proclaimed UGA's colors to be \\\"old gold, black, and crimson\\\". Charles H. Herty, then President of the University of Georgia, felt that old gold was too similar to yellow and that it \\\"symbolized cowardice\\\".\\n[\\n255\\n]\\nAfter the 1893 football game against Tech, Herty removed old gold as an official color.\\n[\\n255\\n]\\nTech would first use old gold for their uniforms, as a proverbial slap in the face to UGA, in their first unofficial football game against Auburn in 1891.\\n[\\n256\\n]\\nGeorgia Tech's school colors would henceforth be old gold and white.\\nIn April 2018 Georgia Tech went through a comprehensive brand redefinement solidifying the school colors into Tech Gold and White as the primary school colors while Navy Blue serves as the contrasting secondary color. The decision to move forward with gold, white and blue is rooted in history, as the first mention of official Georgia Tech class colors came in the Atlanta Constitution in 1891 (white, blue and gold) and the first GT class ring in 1894 also featured gold, white and blue.\\n[\\n257\\n]\\nMascots\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nMain articles:\\nBuzz (mascot)\\nand\\nRamblin' Wreck\\nBuzz, the mascot\\nCostumed in\\nplush\\nto look like a\\nyellow jacket\\n, the official\\nmascot\\nof Georgia Tech is\\nBuzz\\n. Buzz enters the football games at the sound of swarming yellow jackets and proceeds to do a flip on the fifty-yard line GT logo. He then bull rushes the goal post and has been known to knock it out of alignment before football games. Buzz is also notorious for\\ncrowd surfing\\nand general light-hearted trickery amongst Tech and rival fans.\\nThe\\nRamblin' Wreck\\nwas the first official mascot of Georgia Tech. It is a 1930\\nFord Model A\\nSports Coupe. The Wreck has led the football team onto the field every home game since 1961. The Wreck features a gold and white paint job, two gold flags emblazoned with the words \\\"To Hell With Georgia\\\" and \\\"Give 'Em Hell Tech\\\", and a white soft top. The Wreck is maintained by the\\nRamblin' Reck Club\\n, a selective student leadership organization on campus.\\n[\\n258\\n]\\nSpirit organizations\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nTech cheerleaders waving flags after a touchdown\\nThe Ramblin' Reck Club is charged with upholding all school traditions and creating new traditions such as the SWARM. The SWARM is a 900-member spirit group seated along the north end zone or on the court at basketball games. This is the group that typically features\\nbody painting\\n, organized\\nchants\\n, and general\\nfanaticism\\n.\\nThe marching band that performs at halftime and after big plays during the football season is clad in all white and sits next to SWARM at football games providing a dichotomy of white and gold in the North End Zone. The band is also the primary student organization on campus that upholds the tradition of RAT caps, wherein band freshman wear the traditional yellow cap at all band events.\\nFight songs and chants\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nThe band plays the fight songs\\nRamblin' Wreck from Georgia Tech\\nand\\nUp With the White and Gold\\nafter every football score and between every basketball period. At the end of a rendition of either fight song, there is a series of drum beats followed by the cheer \\\"Go Jackets\\\" three times (each time followed by a second cheer of \\\"bust their ass\\\"), then a different drum beat and the cheer \\\"Fight, Win, Drink, Get Naked!\\\" The official cheer only includes \\\"Fight, Win\\\" but most present other than the band and cheerleaders will yell the extended version.\\nIt is also tradition for the band to play the\\n\\\"When You Say Budweiser\\\"\\nafter the third quarter of football and during the second-to-last official timeout of every basketball game. During the\\n\\\"Budweiser Song\\\"\\n, all of the fans in the stadium alternate bending their knees and standing up straight. Other notable band songs are\\nMichael Jackson\\n's\\nThriller\\nfor half-time at the\\nThrillerdome\\n,\\nLudacris\\n'\\nMove Bitch\\nfor large gains in football. Another popular chant is called the Good Word and it begins with asking, \\\"What's the Good Word?\\\" The response from all Tech faithful is, \\\"To Hell With Georgia.\\\" The same question is asked three times and then the followup is asked, \\\"How 'bout them dogs?\\\" And everyone yells, \\\"Piss on 'em.\\\"\\nNotable people\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nMain articles:\\nList of Georgia Institute of Technology alumni\\nand\\nList of Georgia Institute of Technology athletes\\nSee also:\\nCategory:Georgia Tech alumni\\n,\\nCategory:Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets athletes\\n,\\nCategory:Georgia Tech faculty\\n, and\\nCategory:Georgia Tech Research Institute people\\nGeorgia Tech's first two graduates were H.

Two former\\\\nConfederate\\\\nofficers, Major\\\\nJohn Fletcher Hanson\\\\n(an industrialist) and\\\\nNathaniel Edwin Harris\\\\n(a politician and eventually Governor of Georgia), who had become prominent citizens in the town of\\\\nMacon, Georgia\\\\n, after the\\\\nCivil War\\\\n, believed that the South needed to improve its technology to compete with the North\\'s\\\\nindustrialization\\\\n.\\\\n[\\\\n16\\\\n]\\\\n[\\\\n17\\\\n]\\\\nBecause the American South of that era was mainly populated by agricultural workers and few technical developments were occurring, they proposed to establish a technology school.\\\\n[\\\\n16\\\\n]\\\\n[\\\\n17\\\\n]\\\\nIn 1882, the\\\\nGeorgia State Legislature\\\\nauthorized a committee, led by Harris, to visit the Northeast to learn how technology schools worked. They were impressed by the polytechnic educational models developed at the\\\\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\\\\nand the Worcester County Free Institute of Industrial Science (now\\\\nWorcester Polytechnic Institute\\\\n). The committee recommended adapting the Worcester model, which stressed a combination of \\\\\"theory and practice\\\\\", the \\\\\"practice\\\\\" component including student employment and production of consumer items to generate revenue for the school.\\\\n[\\\\n18\\\\n]\\\\nOn October 13, 1885,\\\\nGeorgia Governor\\\\nHenry D. McDaniel\\\\nsigned the bill to create and fund the new school.\\\\n[\\\\n1\\\\n]\\\\nIn 1887, Atlanta pioneer\\\\nRichard Peters\\\\ndonated to the state 4 acres (1.6\\\\u00a0ha) of the site of a failed garden suburb called\\\\nPeters Park\\\\n. The site was bounded on the south by\\\\nNorth Avenue\\\\n, and on the west by Cherry Street.\\\\n[\\\\n1\\\\n]\\\\nHe then sold five adjoining acres of land to the state for\\\\nUS$\\\\n10,000, (equivalent to $350,000 in 2024).\\\\n[\\\\n1\\\\n]\\\\nThis land was near Atlanta\\'s northern city limits at the time of its founding, although the city has since expanded several miles beyond it. A historical marker on the large hill in\\\\nCentral Campus\\\\nsays that the site occupied by the school\\'s first buildings once held fortifications to protect Atlanta during the\\\\nAtlanta campaign\\\\nof the American Civil War.\\\\n[\\\\n19\\\\n]\\\\nThe surrender of the city took place in 1864 on what is today the southwestern boundary of the Georgia Tech campus.\\\\n[\\\\n20\\\\n]\\\\nEarly years\\\\n[\\\\nedit\\\\n]\\\\nAn early picture of Georgia Tech, circa 1899\\\\nThe Georgia School of Technology opened in the fall of 1888 with two buildings.\\\\n[\\\\n16\\\\n]\\\\nOne building (now\\\\nTech Tower\\\\n, an administrative headquarters) had classrooms to teach students; The second building featured a shop and had a\\\\nfoundry\\\\n,\\\\nforge\\\\n,\\\\nboiler room\\\\n, and engine room. It was designed for students to work and produce goods to sell and fund the school. The two buildings were equal in size to show the importance of teaching both the mind and the hands, though, at the time, there was some disagreement to whether the machine shop should have been used to turn a profit.\\\\n[\\\\n16\\\\n]\\\\n[\\\\n18\\\\n]\\\\nOn October 20, 1905,\\\\nU.S. President\\\\nTheodore Roosevelt\\\\nvisited Georgia Tech.

Some are well-known; for example, the most notable of these is the popular but rare tradition of stealing the \\'T\\' from Tech Tower. Tech Tower, Tech\\'s historic primary administrative building, has the letters \\\\\"TECH\\\\\" hanging atop it on each of its four sides. There have been several attempts by students to orchestrate complex plans to steal the huge symbolic letter T, and on occasion they have carried this act out successfully.\\\\nSchool colors\\\\n[\\\\nedit\\\\n]\\\\nGeorgia Tech students hold a heated, long and ongoing rivalry with the University of Georgia, known as Clean, Old-Fashioned Hate. The first known hostilities between the two institutions trace back to 1891. The University of Georgia\\'s literary magazine proclaimed UGA\\'s colors to be \\\\\"old gold, black, and crimson\\\\\". Charles H. Herty, then President of the University of Georgia, felt that old gold was too similar to yellow and that it \\\\\"symbolized cowardice\\\\\".\\\\n[\\\\n255\\\\n]\\\\nAfter the 1893 football game against Tech, Herty removed old gold as an official color.\\\\n[\\\\n255\\\\n]\\\\nTech would first use old gold for their uniforms, as a proverbial slap in the face to UGA, in their first unofficial football game against Auburn in 1891.\\\\n[\\\\n256\\\\n]\\\\nGeorgia Tech\\'s school colors would henceforth be old gold and white.\\\\nIn April 2018 Georgia Tech went through a comprehensive brand redefinement solidifying the school colors into Tech Gold and White as the primary school colors while Navy Blue serves as the contrasting secondary color. The decision to move forward with gold, white and blue is rooted in history, as the first mention of official Georgia Tech class colors came in the Atlanta Constitution in 1891 (white, blue and gold) and the first GT class ring in 1894 also featured gold, white and blue.\\\\n[\\\\n257\\\\n]\\\\nMascots\\\\n[\\\\nedit\\\\n]\\\\nMain articles:\\\\nBuzz (mascot)\\\\nand\\\\nRamblin\\' Wreck\\\\nBuzz, the mascot\\\\nCostumed in\\\\nplush\\\\nto look like a\\\\nyellow jacket\\\\n, the official\\\\nmascot\\\\nof Georgia Tech is\\\\nBuzz\\\\n. Buzz enters the football games at the sound of swarming yellow jackets and proceeds to do a flip on the fifty-yard line GT logo. He then bull rushes the goal post and has been known to knock it out of alignment before football games. Buzz is also notorious for\\\\ncrowd surfing\\\\nand general light-hearted trickery amongst Tech and rival fans.\\\\nThe\\\\nRamblin\\' Wreck\\\\nwas the first official mascot of Georgia Tech. It is a 1930\\\\nFord Model A\\\\nSports Coupe. The Wreck has led the football team onto the field every home game since 1961. The Wreck features a gold and white paint job, two gold flags emblazoned with the words \\\\\"To Hell With Georgia\\\\\" and \\\\\"Give \\'Em Hell Tech\\\\\", and a white soft top. The Wreck is maintained by the\\\\nRamblin\\' Reck Club\\\\n, a selective student leadership organization on campus.\\\\n[\\\\n258\\\\n]\\\\nSpirit organizations\\\\n[\\\\nedit\\\\n]\\\\nTech cheerleaders waving flags after a touchdown\\\\nThe Ramblin\\' Reck Club is charged with upholding all school traditions and creating new traditions such as the SWARM. The SWARM is a 900-member spirit group seated along the north end zone or on the court at basketball games. This is the group that typically features\\\\nbody painting\\\\n, organized\\\\nchants\\\\n, and general\\\\nfanaticism\\\\n.\\\\nThe marching band that performs at halftime and after big plays during the football season is clad in all white and sits next to SWARM at football games providing a dichotomy of white and gold in the North End Zone. The band is also the primary student organization on campus that upholds the tradition of RAT caps, wherein band freshman wear the traditional yellow cap at all band events.\\\\nFight songs and chants\\\\n[\\\\nedit\\\\n]\\\\nThe band plays the fight songs\\\\nRamblin\\' Wreck from Georgia Tech\\\\nand\\\\nUp With the White and Gold\\\\nafter every football score and between every basketball period. At the end of a rendition of either fight song, there is a series of drum beats followed by the cheer \\\\\"Go Jackets\\\\\" three times (each time followed by a second cheer of \\\\\"bust their ass\\\\\"), then a different drum beat and the cheer \\\\\"Fight, Win, Drink, Get Naked!\\\\\" The official cheer only includes \\\\\"Fight, Win\\\\\" but most present other than the band and cheerleaders will yell the extended version.\\\\nIt is also tradition for the band to play the\\\\n\\\\\"When You Say Budweiser\\\\\"\\\\nafter the third quarter of football and during the second-to-last official timeout of every basketball game. During the\\\\n\\\\\"Budweiser Song\\\\\"\\\\n, all of the fans in the stadium alternate bending their knees and standing up straight. Other notable band songs are\\\\nMichael Jackson\\\\n\\'s\\\\nThriller\\\\nfor half-time at the\\\\nThrillerdome\\\\n,\\\\nLudacris\\\\n\\'\\\\nMove Bitch\\\\nfor large gains in football. Another popular chant is called the Good Word and it begins with asking, \\\\\"What\\'s the Good Word?\\\\\" The response from all Tech faithful is, \\\\\"To Hell With Georgia.\\\\\" The same question is asked three times and then the followup is asked, \\\\\"How \\'bout them dogs?\\\\\" And everyone yells, \\\\\"Piss on \\'em.\\\\\"\\\\nNotable people\\\\n[\\\\nedit\\\\n]\\\\nMain articles:\\\\nList of Georgia Institute of Technology alumni\\\\nand\\\\nList of Georgia Institute of Technology athletes\\\\nSee also:\\\\nCategory:Georgia Tech alumni\\\\n,\\\\nCategory:Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets athletes\\\\n,\\\\nCategory:Georgia Tech faculty\\\\n, and\\\\nCategory:Georgia Tech Research Institute people\\\\nGeorgia Tech\\'s first two graduates were H.

This masterpiece transcends the boundaries of automotive engineering and design, setting a new benchmark for luxury. Let's explore the world of the Rolls-Royce Droptail and discover what makes this vehicle the most coveted car in the world.\\nA LEGACY OF LUXURY: THE ROLLS-ROYCE BRAND\\nRolls-Royce has long been synonymous with unparalleled luxury and impeccable craftsmanship. Each vehicle that emerges from its factories is not just a car, but a work of art \\u2013 meticulously crafted to meet the exacting standards of the world's most discerning clientele.\\nThe Droptail continues this proud legacy, pushing the limits of what is possible in automotive design and luxury.\\nTHE ROLLS-ROYCE DROPTAIL: A MASTERPIECE ON WHEELS\\nThe Droptail is the epitome of automotive excellence, blending traditional craftsmanship with modern innovation. Here are some of the key features that justify its monumental price tag:\\nDesign & Craftsmanship\\nThe design of the Rolls-Royce Droptail is a testament to the brand's commitment to craftsmanship. Every line, curve, and detail has been thoughtfully considered to create a silhouette that is both timeless and forward-thinking.\\nThe bespoke nature of Rolls-Royce vehicles means that each Droptail can be personalized to the owner's exact specifications, from the exterior color to the interior trim, making each model a unique piece of automotive history.\\nPerformance & Technology\\nDespite its focus on luxury, the Rolls-Royce Droptail doesn\\u2019t compromise on performance. Equipped with a state-of-the-art powertrain, it delivers an exhilarating and smooth driving experience.\\nAdvanced technology features, from cutting-edge infotainment systems to innovative safety measures, ensure that passengers enjoy unparalleled comfort and convenience.\\nExclusivity & Rarity\\nPart of what makes the Rolls-Royce Droptail so valuable is its exclusivity. Produced in extremely limited quantities, owning a Droptail places you in a highly exclusive club of individuals who possess a vehicle that is as rare as it is beautiful.\\nThis scarcity, combined with the Rolls-Royce pedigree, contributes significantly to the Droptail's status as the most expensive car in the world.\\nTHE TOP 8 MOST EXPENSIVE CARS IN THE WORLD IN 2024\\nBesides the Rolls-Royce Droptail, 2024 has unveiled some of the most awe-inspiring and wallet-straining vehicles ever conceived.\\nRose Noire Droptail:\\nPriced at $32 million, setting a new benchmark for opulence on wheels.\\nRolls Royce Boat Tail:\\nThis model has a $28 million price tag, combining timeless elegance with modern sophistication.\\nBugatti La Voiture Noire:\\nValued at approximately $18.5 million, showcasing the pinnacle of French automotive craftsmanship.\\nPagani Zonda HP Barchetta:\\nCarries a price of $17.5 million, epitomizing Italian engineering finesse.\\nBugatti Centodieci:\\nPriced at $9 million, this car redefines exclusivity. Only ten units are available, making it a collector's dream.\\nLamborghini Revuelto:\\nStarting at $604,000, this model features cutting-edge design and power, standing as a testament to Lamborghini's relentless pursuit of perfection.\\nRolls-Royce Phantom EWB & Ferrari SF90 Spider:\\nCommanding prices in the vicinity of $573,000 and $575,000 respectively, offering unparalleled luxury and performance.\\nThese vehicles represent the zenith of luxury car manufacturing in 2024, not just as modes of transportation but as masterpieces of engineering and design.\\nINSURING A LUXURY CAR\\nInsuring a luxury car is a crucial step in protecting your investment and ensuring peace of mind on the road. Given the high value and specialized nature of luxury vehicles,\\nauto insurance\\npremiums tend to be significantly higher than those for standard cars, reflecting the increased cost of parts, repairs, and the potential for theft.\\nWhen insuring a luxury car, it's essential to seek out insurers that specialize in high-end vehicles and offer tailored coverage options that address the unique needs of luxury car owners. This includes:\\nAgreed value coverage, which ensures you receive the full insured value of the car without depreciation in the event of a total loss\\nComprehensive coverage for repairs at authorized dealerships using original manufacturer parts\\nAdditional protections such as roadside assistance, uninsured motorist coverage, and even exotic car rental reimbursement during repair periods\\nChoosing the right insurance policy for a luxury car involves balancing cost with the level of protection desired, making it important to thoroughly research and compare offerings from different insurers to find the best fit for your specific vehicle and driving habits.\\nThe Rolls-Royce Droptail stands alone at the summit of automotive luxury in 2024, commanding a price of $30 million. It\\u2019s a vehicle that redefines the parameters of luxury, combining Rolls-Royce's storied heritage with groundbreaking innovation. For the elite few who call it their own, the Droptail is not just the most expensive car in the world \\u2013 it\\u2019s a lifelong dream realized, an emblem of their success and refined taste.\\nIf you need help finding the best luxury car insurance coverage for the best price, speak to a SimplyIOA agent at\\n833.872.4467\\nor\\nget an auto insurance quote online now.\\nshare this post\\n5 Essential Tips for Classic Car Maintenance & Preservation\\nFor many enthusiasts, classic cars are more than just vehicles; they're rolling pieces of history.\\nRead More\\nWhat is a \\u201cBarn Find\\u201d & Why Do Car Collectors Love Them?\\nImagine stumbling upon a dusty old garage or neglected barn, only to find a forgotten vehicle or...\\nRead More\\nHow Mortgage Servicers Are Adapting to New Insurance Risk Challenges\\nThe mortgage servicing industry stands at the corner of financial stability and consumer trust.\\nRead More\\nGet Car Insurance\\nLearn more\\nGet Home Insurance\\nLearn more\\nSelect the cover you need to start a quote\\nCondo\\nMotorcycle\\nEarthquake\\nFire\\nPersonal Life\\nFlood\\nRenters\\nHurricane\\nRV\\nMobile Home\\nUmbrella\\nBoat\\nSnowmobile\\nATV\\nLearn more\\nGet Car\\nInsurance\\nLearn more\\nGet Home\\nInsurance\\nAddress\\n1855 West State Road 434\\nLongwood, FL 32750\\nCustomer Service\\nSpeak to one of our friendly agents\\n833.872.4467\\nService:\\n8am - 8pm EST, Monday \\u2013 Friday\\nSales:\\n8am - 8pm EST, Monday \\u2013 Friday\\nAbout\\nHome insurance\\nAuto insurance\\nFAQs\\nContact\\nCareers\\nPartnership\\nTerms & Conditions\\nPrivacy Policy\\nCookies Policy\\nSOC 2 Certification\\nStories\\nDo Not Sell or Share My Personal Information\\nAddress\\n1855 West State Road 434\\nLongwood, FL 32750\\nGive us a call\\nSpeak to one of our friendly agents\\n833.872.4467\\nand we\\u2019ll take you through the process.

This masterpiece transcends the boundaries of automotive engineering and design, setting a new benchmark for luxury. Let\\'s explore the world of the Rolls-Royce Droptail and discover what makes this vehicle the most coveted car in the world.\\\\nA LEGACY OF LUXURY: THE ROLLS-ROYCE BRAND\\\\nRolls-Royce has long been synonymous with unparalleled luxury and impeccable craftsmanship. Each vehicle that emerges from its factories is not just a car, but a work of art \\\\u2013 meticulously crafted to meet the exacting standards of the world\\'s most discerning clientele.\\\\nThe Droptail continues this proud legacy, pushing the limits of what is possible in automotive design and luxury.\\\\nTHE ROLLS-ROYCE DROPTAIL: A MASTERPIECE ON WHEELS\\\\nThe Droptail is the epitome of automotive excellence, blending traditional craftsmanship with modern innovation. Here are some of the key features that justify its monumental price tag:\\\\nDesign & Craftsmanship\\\\nThe design of the Rolls-Royce Droptail is a testament to the brand\\'s commitment to craftsmanship. Every line, curve, and detail has been thoughtfully considered to create a silhouette that is both timeless and forward-thinking.\\\\nThe bespoke nature of Rolls-Royce vehicles means that each Droptail can be personalized to the owner\\'s exact specifications, from the exterior color to the interior trim, making each model a unique piece of automotive history.\\\\nPerformance & Technology\\\\nDespite its focus on luxury, the Rolls-Royce Droptail doesn\\\\u2019t compromise on performance. Equipped with a state-of-the-art powertrain, it delivers an exhilarating and smooth driving experience.\\\\nAdvanced technology features, from cutting-edge infotainment systems to innovative safety measures, ensure that passengers enjoy unparalleled comfort and convenience.\\\\nExclusivity & Rarity\\\\nPart of what makes the Rolls-Royce Droptail so valuable is its exclusivity. Produced in extremely limited quantities, owning a Droptail places you in a highly exclusive club of individuals who possess a vehicle that is as rare as it is beautiful.\\\\nThis scarcity, combined with the Rolls-Royce pedigree, contributes significantly to the Droptail\\'s status as the most expensive car in the world.\\\\nTHE TOP 8 MOST EXPENSIVE CARS IN THE WORLD IN 2024\\\\nBesides the Rolls-Royce Droptail, 2024 has unveiled some of the most awe-inspiring and wallet-straining vehicles ever conceived.\\\\nRose Noire Droptail:\\\\nPriced at $32 million, setting a new benchmark for opulence on wheels.\\\\nRolls Royce Boat Tail:\\\\nThis model has a $28 million price tag, combining timeless elegance with modern sophistication.\\\\nBugatti La Voiture Noire:\\\\nValued at approximately $18.5 million, showcasing the pinnacle of French automotive craftsmanship.\\\\nPagani Zonda HP Barchetta:\\\\nCarries a price of $17.5 million, epitomizing Italian engineering finesse.\\\\nBugatti Centodieci:\\\\nPriced at $9 million, this car redefines exclusivity. Only ten units are available, making it a collector\\'s dream.\\\\nLamborghini Revuelto:\\\\nStarting at $604,000, this model features cutting-edge design and power, standing as a testament to Lamborghini\\'s relentless pursuit of perfection.\\\\nRolls-Royce Phantom EWB & Ferrari SF90 Spider:\\\\nCommanding prices in the vicinity of $573,000 and $575,000 respectively, offering unparalleled luxury and performance.\\\\nThese vehicles represent the zenith of luxury car manufacturing in 2024, not just as modes of transportation but as masterpieces of engineering and design.\\\\nINSURING A LUXURY CAR\\\\nInsuring a luxury car is a crucial step in protecting your investment and ensuring peace of mind on the road. Given the high value and specialized nature of luxury vehicles,\\\\nauto insurance\\\\npremiums tend to be significantly higher than those for standard cars, reflecting the increased cost of parts, repairs, and the potential for theft.\\\\nWhen insuring a luxury car, it\\'s essential to seek out insurers that specialize in high-end vehicles and offer tailored coverage options that address the unique needs of luxury car owners. This includes:\\\\nAgreed value coverage, which ensures you receive the full insured value of the car without depreciation in the event of a total loss\\\\nComprehensive coverage for repairs at authorized dealerships using original manufacturer parts\\\\nAdditional protections such as roadside assistance, uninsured motorist coverage, and even exotic car rental reimbursement during repair periods\\\\nChoosing the right insurance policy for a luxury car involves balancing cost with the level of protection desired, making it important to thoroughly research and compare offerings from different insurers to find the best fit for your specific vehicle and driving habits.\\\\nThe Rolls-Royce Droptail stands alone at the summit of automotive luxury in 2024, commanding a price of $30 million. It\\\\u2019s a vehicle that redefines the parameters of luxury, combining Rolls-Royce\\'s storied heritage with groundbreaking innovation. For the elite few who call it their own, the Droptail is not just the most expensive car in the world \\\\u2013 it\\\\u2019s a lifelong dream realized, an emblem of their success and refined taste.\\\\nIf you need help finding the best luxury car insurance coverage for the best price, speak to a SimplyIOA agent at\\\\n833.872.4467\\\\nor\\\\nget an auto insurance quote online now.\\\\nshare this post\\\\n5 Essential Tips for Classic Car Maintenance & Preservation\\\\nFor many enthusiasts, classic cars are more than just vehicles; they\\'re rolling pieces of history.\\\\nRead More\\\\nWhat is a \\\\u201cBarn Find\\\\u201d & Why Do Car Collectors Love Them?\\\\nImagine stumbling upon a dusty old garage or neglected barn, only to find a forgotten vehicle or...\\\\nRead More\\\\nHow Mortgage Servicers Are Adapting to New Insurance Risk Challenges\\\\nThe mortgage servicing industry stands at the corner of financial stability and consumer trust.\\\\nRead More\\\\nGet Car Insurance\\\\nLearn more\\\\nGet Home Insurance\\\\nLearn more\\\\nSelect the cover you need to start a quote\\\\nCondo\\\\nMotorcycle\\\\nEarthquake\\\\nFire\\\\nPersonal Life\\\\nFlood\\\\nRenters\\\\nHurricane\\\\nRV\\\\nMobile Home\\\\nUmbrella\\\\nBoat\\\\nSnowmobile\\\\nATV\\\\nLearn more\\\\nGet Car\\\\nInsurance\\\\nLearn more\\\\nGet Home\\\\nInsurance\\\\nAddress\\\\n1855 West State Road 434\\\\nLongwood, FL 32750\\\\nCustomer Service\\\\nSpeak to one of our friendly agents\\\\n833.872.4467\\\\nService:\\\\n8am - 8pm EST, Monday \\\\u2013 Friday\\\\nSales:\\\\n8am - 8pm EST, Monday \\\\u2013 Friday\\\\nAbout\\\\nHome insurance\\\\nAuto insurance\\\\nFAQs\\\\nContact\\\\nCareers\\\\nPartnership\\\\nTerms & Conditions\\\\nPrivacy Policy\\\\nCookies Policy\\\\nSOC 2 Certification\\\\nStories\\\\nDo Not Sell or Share My Personal Information\\\\nAddress\\\\n1855 West State Road 434\\\\nLongwood, FL 32750\\\\nGive us a call\\\\nSpeak to one of our friendly agents\\\\n833.872.4467\\\\nand we\\\\u2019ll take you through the process.

This masterpiece transcends the boundaries of automotive engineering and design, setting a new benchmark for luxury. Let\\'s explore the world of the Rolls-Royce Droptail and discover what makes this vehicle the most coveted car in the world.\\\\nA LEGACY OF LUXURY: THE ROLLS-ROYCE BRAND\\\\nRolls-Royce has long been synonymous with unparalleled luxury and impeccable craftsmanship. Each vehicle that emerges from its factories is not just a car, but a work of art \\\\u2013 meticulously crafted to meet the exacting standards of the world\\'s most discerning clientele.\\\\nThe Droptail continues this proud legacy, pushing the limits of what is possible in automotive design and luxury.\\\\nTHE ROLLS-ROYCE DROPTAIL: A MASTERPIECE ON WHEELS\\\\nThe Droptail is the epitome of automotive excellence, blending traditional craftsmanship with modern innovation. Here are some of the key features that justify its monumental price tag:\\\\nDesign & Craftsmanship\\\\nThe design of the Rolls-Royce Droptail is a testament to the brand\\'s commitment to craftsmanship. Every line, curve, and detail has been thoughtfully considered to create a silhouette that is both timeless and forward-thinking.\\\\nThe bespoke nature of Rolls-Royce vehicles means that each Droptail can be personalized to the owner\\'s exact specifications, from the exterior color to the interior trim, making each model a unique piece of automotive history.\\\\nPerformance & Technology\\\\nDespite its focus on luxury, the Rolls-Royce Droptail doesn\\\\u2019t compromise on performance. Equipped with a state-of-the-art powertrain, it delivers an exhilarating and smooth driving experience.\\\\nAdvanced technology features, from cutting-edge infotainment systems to innovative safety measures, ensure that passengers enjoy unparalleled comfort and convenience.\\\\nExclusivity & Rarity\\\\nPart of what makes the Rolls-Royce Droptail so valuable is its exclusivity. Produced in extremely limited quantities, owning a Droptail places you in a highly exclusive club of individuals who possess a vehicle that is as rare as it is beautiful.\\\\nThis scarcity, combined with the Rolls-Royce pedigree, contributes significantly to the Droptail\\'s status as the most expensive car in the world.\\\\nTHE TOP 8 MOST EXPENSIVE CARS IN THE WORLD IN 2024\\\\nBesides the Rolls-Royce Droptail, 2024 has unveiled some of the most awe-inspiring and wallet-straining vehicles ever conceived.\\\\nRose Noire Droptail:\\\\nPriced at $32 million, setting a new benchmark for opulence on wheels.\\\\nRolls Royce Boat Tail:\\\\nThis model has a $28 million price tag, combining timeless elegance with modern sophistication.\\\\nBugatti La Voiture Noire:\\\\nValued at approximately $18.5 million, showcasing the pinnacle of French automotive craftsmanship.\\\\nPagani Zonda HP Barchetta:\\\\nCarries a price of $17.5 million, epitomizing Italian engineering finesse.\\\\nBugatti Centodieci:\\\\nPriced at $9 million, this car redefines exclusivity. Only ten units are available, making it a collector\\'s dream.\\\\nLamborghini Revuelto:\\\\nStarting at $604,000, this model features cutting-edge design and power, standing as a testament to Lamborghini\\'s relentless pursuit of perfection.\\\\nRolls-Royce Phantom EWB & Ferrari SF90 Spider:\\\\nCommanding prices in the vicinity of $573,000 and $575,000 respectively, offering unparalleled luxury and performance.\\\\nThese vehicles represent the zenith of luxury car manufacturing in 2024, not just as modes of transportation but as masterpieces of engineering and design.\\\\nINSURING A LUXURY CAR\\\\nInsuring a luxury car is a crucial step in protecting your investment and ensuring peace of mind on the road. Given the high value and specialized nature of luxury vehicles,\\\\nauto insurance\\\\npremiums tend to be significantly higher than those for standard cars, reflecting the increased cost of parts, repairs, and the potential for theft.\\\\nWhen insuring a luxury car, it\\'s essential to seek out insurers that specialize in high-end vehicles and offer tailored coverage options that address the unique needs of luxury car owners. This includes:\\\\nAgreed value coverage, which ensures you receive the full insured value of the car without depreciation in the event of a total loss\\\\nComprehensive coverage for repairs at authorized dealerships using original manufacturer parts\\\\nAdditional protections such as roadside assistance, uninsured motorist coverage, and even exotic car rental reimbursement during repair periods\\\\nChoosing the right insurance policy for a luxury car involves balancing cost with the level of protection desired, making it important to thoroughly research and compare offerings from different insurers to find the best fit for your specific vehicle and driving habits.\\\\nThe Rolls-Royce Droptail stands alone at the summit of automotive luxury in 2024, commanding a price of $30 million. It\\\\u2019s a vehicle that redefines the parameters of luxury, combining Rolls-Royce\\'s storied heritage with groundbreaking innovation. For the elite few who call it their own, the Droptail is not just the most expensive car in the world \\\\u2013 it\\\\u2019s a lifelong dream realized, an emblem of their success and refined taste.\\\\nIf you need help finding the best luxury car insurance coverage for the best price, speak to a SimplyIOA agent at\\\\n833.872.4467\\\\nor\\\\nget an auto insurance quote online now.\\\\nshare this post\\\\n5 Essential Tips for Classic Car Maintenance & Preservation\\\\nFor many enthusiasts, classic cars are more than just vehicles; they\\'re rolling pieces of history.\\\\nRead More\\\\nWhat is a \\\\u201cBarn Find\\\\u201d & Why Do Car Collectors Love Them?\\\\nImagine stumbling upon a dusty old garage or neglected barn, only to find a forgotten vehicle or...\\\\nRead More\\\\nHow Mortgage Servicers Are Adapting to New Insurance Risk Challenges\\\\nThe mortgage servicing industry stands at the corner of financial stability and consumer trust.\\\\nRead More\\\\nGet Car Insurance\\\\nLearn more\\\\nGet Home Insurance\\\\nLearn more\\\\nSelect the cover you need to start a quote\\\\nCondo\\\\nMotorcycle\\\\nEarthquake\\\\nFire\\\\nPersonal Life\\\\nFlood\\\\nRenters\\\\nHurricane\\\\nRV\\\\nMobile Home\\\\nUmbrella\\\\nBoat\\\\nSnowmobile\\\\nATV\\\\nLearn more\\\\nGet Car\\\\nInsurance\\\\nLearn more\\\\nGet Home\\\\nInsurance\\\\nAddress\\\\n1855 West State Road 434\\\\nLongwood, FL 32750\\\\nCustomer Service\\\\nSpeak to one of our friendly agents\\\\n833.872.4467\\\\nService:\\\\n8am - 8pm EST, Monday \\\\u2013 Friday\\\\nSales:\\\\n8am - 8pm EST, Monday \\\\u2013 Friday\\\\nAbout\\\\nHome insurance\\\\nAuto insurance\\\\nFAQs\\\\nContact\\\\nCareers\\\\nPartnership\\\\nTerms & Conditions\\\\nPrivacy Policy\\\\nCookies Policy\\\\nSOC 2 Certification\\\\nStories\\\\nDo Not Sell or Share My Personal Information\\\\nAddress\\\\n1855 West State Road 434\\\\nLongwood, FL 32750\\\\nGive us a call\\\\nSpeak to one of our friendly agents\\\\n833.872.4467\\\\nand we\\\\u2019ll take you through the process.

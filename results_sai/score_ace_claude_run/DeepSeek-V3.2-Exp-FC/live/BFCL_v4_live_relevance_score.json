The image generation tools I have available are better suited for more general or realistic imagery rather than highly stylized artistic interpretations.\n\nFor this type of detailed, stylized digital painting that blends cyberpunk with Art Nouveau elements, you might want to consider:\n\n- Using specialized AI art platforms like Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, or DALL-E 3 which are better equipped for complex artistic styles\n- Working with a digital artist who specializes in cyberpunk or Art Nouveau styles\n- Using image editing software like Photoshop with custom brushes and filters to achieve that fluid illustration quality\n\nWould you like me to help you with any other aspects of your creative project, or perhaps create a simpler image that I can generate with my current tools?", "decoded_result": null, "error": ["Invalid syntax.

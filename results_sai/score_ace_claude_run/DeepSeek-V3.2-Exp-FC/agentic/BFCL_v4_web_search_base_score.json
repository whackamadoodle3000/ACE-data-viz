Kamruzzaman\\n[\\n1\\n]\\nWebsite\\nbangladeshmuseum\\n.gov\\n.bd\\nThe Bangladesh National Museum is the national repository of Bangladesh's cultural and historical artifacts, located in the Shahbag area of Dhaka. It was established on March 20, 1913, under the name Dhaka Museum, and was formally inaugurated on August 7, 1913. With an initial collection of 379 objects, it was opened to the public on August 25, 1914.\\n[\\n2\\n]\\nAfter the independence of Bangladesh in 1971, the institution was reorganized under the name Bangladesh National Museum, incorporating various parts of the former Dhaka Museum, and was formally inaugurated in its present form in 1983.\\n[\\n3\\n]\\nThe museum has departments of ethnography and decorative art, history and classical art, natural history, and world civilization. Artifacts from the prehistoric era to contemporary history are displayed here, which include over 50,000 ancient and medieval coins, Buddhist sculptures from the Gandhara period, and exhibitions related to the 1971 Liberation War.\\n[\\n4\\n]\\nThe idol of\\nRishabhdeva\\nin seated posture in display.\\nHistory\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nBangladesh National Museum designed by\\nSyed Mainul Hossain\\nIn 1855, the Asiatic Society of Bengal proposed establishing a museum in Dhaka, but it was postponed due to logistical constraints. Later, in 1907, this initiative re-emerged among the elite class of Dhaka. Following this, on March 20, 1913, the Dhaka Museum was formally established by the government of undivided Bengal. It was initially located in a room of the old Secretariat building (later part of Dhaka Medical College Hospital). The institution was supported by subscriptions amounting to nearly 10,000 taka from the residents of Dhaka and an initial government grant of 2,000 taka. On August 7, 1913, the Lieutenant Governor of Bengal, Lord Thomas David Gibson Carmichael, inaugurated it for the public in the old building of Jagannath University College, in the presence of local dignitaries. The initial collection comprised about 500 items, primarily including regional archaeological artifacts, coins, manuscripts, and folk art.\\n[\\n5\\n]\\nAs the collection grew, it was relocated to the Nimtali Baroduari building by 1915.\\n[\\n6\\n]\\nAfter the partition of India in 1947, the institution continued to operate as the Dhaka Museum in East Pakistan and faced several administrative challenges. For example, following the death of its first curator, Nalini Kanta Bhattasali, there was no permanent curator from 1947 to 1951, and during this time, its premises were temporarily occupied by a press agency.\\n[\\n7\\n]\\nA part-time curator was appointed in 1951-1952, and in 1954, Enayetur Rahman joined as the curator. Exhibits from sites damaged by the attacks of the Pakistan Army in 1971 (such as the Dinajpur Rajbari and Baldha Museum) were transferred here. Additionally, the collection of war-related documents and artifacts began with the aim of documenting information about the Bengali liberation struggle.\\n[\\n8\\n]\\nAfter independence, in 1972, the institution was renamed 'Bangladesh National Museum' in line with the identity of the newly independent state, and it officially received this name through a government order in 1974. A Trustee Board was formed in 1970 and a National Museum Commission in 1974 for its oversight. As part of the restructuring during the 1970s and 1980s, a new site for the museum in Shahbagh was approved by ECNEC in December 1975. Specialized curatorial departments, such as anthropology, decorative arts, and history, were established to manage the growing collection. Finally, on November 17, 1983, the new building in Shahbagh, equipped with modern facilities, was opened to the public.\\n[\\n9\\n]\\nBy 2017, as a result of ongoing acquisitions and research, the collection of the Bangladesh National Museum reached 91,287 artifacts, among which historical, ethnographic, and natural history items are particularly noteworthy.\\n[\\n10\\n]\\nAs part of a broader institutional modernization, the museum initiated a digitization project in 2012. Its objective was to create a database of the entire collection, improving access to and preservation of artifacts within the limited exhibition space.\\n[\\n11\\n]\\nIn April 2017, the museum launched a 360-degree virtual gallery, making selected exhibits accessible to a global audience through online tours.\\n[\\n12\\n]\\nFurthermore, since 2010, UNESCO has been collaborating with the institution on work related to intangible cultural heritage.\\n[\\n13\\n]\\nVisitors\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nOn an average more than 2000 visitors come to visit the Bangladesh National Museum every day. Foreigners are also among them. Visitor fee is Tk 40 for adults and Tk 20 for minors, Tk 500 for foreigners and Tk 300 for visitors from SAARC countries.\\n[\\n14\\n]\\nHowever, tickets are not required for children below 3 years of age and physically challenged persons.\\nStructure\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nThe categories of artifacts of the National Museum are:\\nHistory and Classical Art\\nEthnology and Decorative Arts\\nContemporary Art and World Civilization\\nDepartment of Natural History\\nConservation Laboratory\\nThere is also a public education department.\\nManagement structure\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nBangladesh National Museum is an autonomous institution established by law and controlled by a board of trustees. However, a director general appointed by the government holds the overall responsibility as the chief executive of the museum. There are currently 330 officers and employees working in the Bangladesh National Museum.\\nGround floor\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nThe ground floor consists of some old guns at the entrance and the hall where the people book their tickets or assemble to hear the history of the museum. The hall leads to a grand staircase. Beside the hall, there is a smaller room which also acts like the hall (it is also used by the guides to tell the visitors about the history) and a simple staircase.\\nFirst floor\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nThe first floor is divided into 22 rooms.\\nFirst room\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nThe first room displays a large map showing the map of\\nBangladesh\\nand its 64 districts.\\nSecond room\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nThe second room consists of a large statue of a\\nroyal Bengal tiger\\n.\\nThird-tenth rooms\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nThese rooms consist of natural beauties found in Bangladesh.

Kamruzzaman\\\\n[\\\\n1\\\\n]\\\\nWebsite\\\\nbangladeshmuseum\\\\n.gov\\\\n.bd\\\\nThe Bangladesh National Museum is the national repository of Bangladesh\\'s cultural and historical artifacts, located in the Shahbag area of Dhaka. It was established on March 20, 1913, under the name Dhaka Museum, and was formally inaugurated on August 7, 1913. With an initial collection of 379 objects, it was opened to the public on August 25, 1914.\\\\n[\\\\n2\\\\n]\\\\nAfter the independence of Bangladesh in 1971, the institution was reorganized under the name Bangladesh National Museum, incorporating various parts of the former Dhaka Museum, and was formally inaugurated in its present form in 1983.\\\\n[\\\\n3\\\\n]\\\\nThe museum has departments of ethnography and decorative art, history and classical art, natural history, and world civilization. Artifacts from the prehistoric era to contemporary history are displayed here, which include over 50,000 ancient and medieval coins, Buddhist sculptures from the Gandhara period, and exhibitions related to the 1971 Liberation War.\\\\n[\\\\n4\\\\n]\\\\nThe idol of\\\\nRishabhdeva\\\\nin seated posture in display.\\\\nHistory\\\\n[\\\\nedit\\\\n]\\\\nBangladesh National Museum designed by\\\\nSyed Mainul Hossain\\\\nIn 1855, the Asiatic Society of Bengal proposed establishing a museum in Dhaka, but it was postponed due to logistical constraints. Later, in 1907, this initiative re-emerged among the elite class of Dhaka. Following this, on March 20, 1913, the Dhaka Museum was formally established by the government of undivided Bengal. It was initially located in a room of the old Secretariat building (later part of Dhaka Medical College Hospital). The institution was supported by subscriptions amounting to nearly 10,000 taka from the residents of Dhaka and an initial government grant of 2,000 taka. On August 7, 1913, the Lieutenant Governor of Bengal, Lord Thomas David Gibson Carmichael, inaugurated it for the public in the old building of Jagannath University College, in the presence of local dignitaries. The initial collection comprised about 500 items, primarily including regional archaeological artifacts, coins, manuscripts, and folk art.\\\\n[\\\\n5\\\\n]\\\\nAs the collection grew, it was relocated to the Nimtali Baroduari building by 1915.\\\\n[\\\\n6\\\\n]\\\\nAfter the partition of India in 1947, the institution continued to operate as the Dhaka Museum in East Pakistan and faced several administrative challenges. For example, following the death of its first curator, Nalini Kanta Bhattasali, there was no permanent curator from 1947 to 1951, and during this time, its premises were temporarily occupied by a press agency.\\\\n[\\\\n7\\\\n]\\\\nA part-time curator was appointed in 1951-1952, and in 1954, Enayetur Rahman joined as the curator. Exhibits from sites damaged by the attacks of the Pakistan Army in 1971 (such as the Dinajpur Rajbari and Baldha Museum) were transferred here. Additionally, the collection of war-related documents and artifacts began with the aim of documenting information about the Bengali liberation struggle.\\\\n[\\\\n8\\\\n]\\\\nAfter independence, in 1972, the institution was renamed \\'Bangladesh National Museum\\' in line with the identity of the newly independent state, and it officially received this name through a government order in 1974. A Trustee Board was formed in 1970 and a National Museum Commission in 1974 for its oversight. As part of the restructuring during the 1970s and 1980s, a new site for the museum in Shahbagh was approved by ECNEC in December 1975. Specialized curatorial departments, such as anthropology, decorative arts, and history, were established to manage the growing collection. Finally, on November 17, 1983, the new building in Shahbagh, equipped with modern facilities, was opened to the public.\\\\n[\\\\n9\\\\n]\\\\nBy 2017, as a result of ongoing acquisitions and research, the collection of the Bangladesh National Museum reached 91,287 artifacts, among which historical, ethnographic, and natural history items are particularly noteworthy.\\\\n[\\\\n10\\\\n]\\\\nAs part of a broader institutional modernization, the museum initiated a digitization project in 2012. Its objective was to create a database of the entire collection, improving access to and preservation of artifacts within the limited exhibition space.\\\\n[\\\\n11\\\\n]\\\\nIn April 2017, the museum launched a 360-degree virtual gallery, making selected exhibits accessible to a global audience through online tours.\\\\n[\\\\n12\\\\n]\\\\nFurthermore, since 2010, UNESCO has been collaborating with the institution on work related to intangible cultural heritage.\\\\n[\\\\n13\\\\n]\\\\nVisitors\\\\n[\\\\nedit\\\\n]\\\\nOn an average more than 2000 visitors come to visit the Bangladesh National Museum every day. Foreigners are also among them. Visitor fee is Tk 40 for adults and Tk 20 for minors, Tk 500 for foreigners and Tk 300 for visitors from SAARC countries.\\\\n[\\\\n14\\\\n]\\\\nHowever, tickets are not required for children below 3 years of age and physically challenged persons.\\\\nStructure\\\\n[\\\\nedit\\\\n]\\\\nThe categories of artifacts of the National Museum are:\\\\nHistory and Classical Art\\\\nEthnology and Decorative Arts\\\\nContemporary Art and World Civilization\\\\nDepartment of Natural History\\\\nConservation Laboratory\\\\nThere is also a public education department.\\\\nManagement structure\\\\n[\\\\nedit\\\\n]\\\\nBangladesh National Museum is an autonomous institution established by law and controlled by a board of trustees.

There are currently 330 officers and employees working in the Bangladesh National Museum.\\\\nGround floor\\\\n[\\\\nedit\\\\n]\\\\nThe ground floor consists of some old guns at the entrance and the hall where the people book their tickets or assemble to hear the history of the museum. The hall leads to a grand staircase.

Kamruzzaman\\\\n[\\\\n1\\\\n]\\\\nWebsite\\\\nbangladeshmuseum\\\\n.gov\\\\n.bd\\\\nThe Bangladesh National Museum is the national repository of Bangladesh\\'s cultural and historical artifacts, located in the Shahbag area of Dhaka. It was established on March 20, 1913, under the name Dhaka Museum, and was formally inaugurated on August 7, 1913. With an initial collection of 379 objects, it was opened to the public on August 25, 1914.\\\\n[\\\\n2\\\\n]\\\\nAfter the independence of Bangladesh in 1971, the institution was reorganized under the name Bangladesh National Museum, incorporating various parts of the former Dhaka Museum, and was formally inaugurated in its present form in 1983.\\\\n[\\\\n3\\\\n]\\\\nThe museum has departments of ethnography and decorative art, history and classical art, natural history, and world civilization. Artifacts from the prehistoric era to contemporary history are displayed here, which include over 50,000 ancient and medieval coins, Buddhist sculptures from the Gandhara period, and exhibitions related to the 1971 Liberation War.\\\\n[\\\\n4\\\\n]\\\\nThe idol of\\\\nRishabhdeva\\\\nin seated posture in display.\\\\nHistory\\\\n[\\\\nedit\\\\n]\\\\nBangladesh National Museum designed by\\\\nSyed Mainul Hossain\\\\nIn 1855, the Asiatic Society of Bengal proposed establishing a museum in Dhaka, but it was postponed due to logistical constraints. Later, in 1907, this initiative re-emerged among the elite class of Dhaka. Following this, on March 20, 1913, the Dhaka Museum was formally established by the government of undivided Bengal. It was initially located in a room of the old Secretariat building (later part of Dhaka Medical College Hospital). The institution was supported by subscriptions amounting to nearly 10,000 taka from the residents of Dhaka and an initial government grant of 2,000 taka. On August 7, 1913, the Lieutenant Governor of Bengal, Lord Thomas David Gibson Carmichael, inaugurated it for the public in the old building of Jagannath University College, in the presence of local dignitaries. The initial collection comprised about 500 items, primarily including regional archaeological artifacts, coins, manuscripts, and folk art.\\\\n[\\\\n5\\\\n]\\\\nAs the collection grew, it was relocated to the Nimtali Baroduari building by 1915.\\\\n[\\\\n6\\\\n]\\\\nAfter the partition of India in 1947, the institution continued to operate as the Dhaka Museum in East Pakistan and faced several administrative challenges. For example, following the death of its first curator, Nalini Kanta Bhattasali, there was no permanent curator from 1947 to 1951, and during this time, its premises were temporarily occupied by a press agency.\\\\n[\\\\n7\\\\n]\\\\nA part-time curator was appointed in 1951-1952, and in 1954, Enayetur Rahman joined as the curator. Exhibits from sites damaged by the attacks of the Pakistan Army in 1971 (such as the Dinajpur Rajbari and Baldha Museum) were transferred here. Additionally, the collection of war-related documents and artifacts began with the aim of documenting information about the Bengali liberation struggle.\\\\n[\\\\n8\\\\n]\\\\nAfter independence, in 1972, the institution was renamed \\'Bangladesh National Museum\\' in line with the identity of the newly independent state, and it officially received this name through a government order in 1974. A Trustee Board was formed in 1970 and a National Museum Commission in 1974 for its oversight. As part of the restructuring during the 1970s and 1980s, a new site for the museum in Shahbagh was approved by ECNEC in December 1975. Specialized curatorial departments, such as anthropology, decorative arts, and history, were established to manage the growing collection. Finally, on November 17, 1983, the new building in Shahbagh, equipped with modern facilities, was opened to the public.\\\\n[\\\\n9\\\\n]\\\\nBy 2017, as a result of ongoing acquisitions and research, the collection of the Bangladesh National Museum reached 91,287 artifacts, among which historical, ethnographic, and natural history items are particularly noteworthy.\\\\n[\\\\n10\\\\n]\\\\nAs part of a broader institutional modernization, the museum initiated a digitization project in 2012. Its objective was to create a database of the entire collection, improving access to and preservation of artifacts within the limited exhibition space.\\\\n[\\\\n11\\\\n]\\\\nIn April 2017, the museum launched a 360-degree virtual gallery, making selected exhibits accessible to a global audience through online tours.\\\\n[\\\\n12\\\\n]\\\\nFurthermore, since 2010, UNESCO has been collaborating with the institution on work related to intangible cultural heritage.\\\\n[\\\\n13\\\\n]\\\\nVisitors\\\\n[\\\\nedit\\\\n]\\\\nOn an average more than 2000 visitors come to visit the Bangladesh National Museum every day. Foreigners are also among them. Visitor fee is Tk 40 for adults and Tk 20 for minors, Tk 500 for foreigners and Tk 300 for visitors from SAARC countries.\\\\n[\\\\n14\\\\n]\\\\nHowever, tickets are not required for children below 3 years of age and physically challenged persons.\\\\nStructure\\\\n[\\\\nedit\\\\n]\\\\nThe categories of artifacts of the National Museum are:\\\\nHistory and Classical Art\\\\nEthnology and Decorative Arts\\\\nContemporary Art and World Civilization\\\\nDepartment of Natural History\\\\nConservation Laboratory\\\\nThere is also a public education department.\\\\nManagement structure\\\\n[\\\\nedit\\\\n]\\\\nBangladesh National Museum is an autonomous institution established by law and controlled by a board of trustees.

At the turn of the twentieth century Lord Curzon, Viceroy of India, by his policy of provincial readjustment, provided the political ground for the establishment of a museum in Dhaka. He partitioned Bengal on 16 October 1905. The historic city of Dhaka became the capital of the new Province of Eastern Bengal and Assam. Consequently, Dhaka witnessed a tremendous physical growth with all-round development. The proposal to start a museum in Dhaka was first mooted in the autumn of 1905 in connection with the transfer of the Shillong Coin Cabinet to Dhaka. As a result of a letter, dated 1 March 1910, submitted by H. E. Stapleton in his capacity as the Honorary Numismatist to the Provincial Government, to the Director of Public Instruction. Sir Lancelot Hare, Lieutenant Governor of Eastern Bengal and Assam, passed orders for the selection of a site for a museum in Dhaka. But no definite action was taken until 1912 when the proposal for starting a university in Dhaka brought the matter again into prominence. As the partition of Bengal was revoked on 1 April 1912, the thought that the glory of the old and illustrious city was once more to wane, saddened the elites of Dhaka. They began to press their demand for developing the future university town. Because of the absence of a public museum in Eastern Bengal many antiquities that turned up on casual excavation in the Dhaka and Chittagong Divisions, were removed to the Indian Museum in Kolkata. This position was unacceptable to the elites of Dhaka. They met Lord Thomas David Baron Carmichael, the Governor of the Presidency of Bengal, under the leadership of N. Bonham-Carter, Commissioner, Dhaka Division, at a conversazione held in the Northbrook Hall on 25 July 1912. The purpose of the meeting was to make the final attempt to realize their long standing claim to a museum in Dhaka. Their address of welcome to the Governor emphasized the immediate necessity of the establishment of a university, a museum and a public library in Dhaka which had by that time been again reduced to the status of a district town. The address also drew the attention of Lord Carmichael to a temporary exhibition of a large number of antiquities gathered together mostly on loan from different sources. The Governor conceded to the demand for a museum and was pleased shortly afterwards to make a grant of Rs. 2,000 to cover the initial expenditure on the proposed museum. When the conversation was over, most of the exhibits were provisionally deposited in the Dhaka Collectorate and in a few other places.To house the collection, a room in the Secretariat (now the Dhaka Medical College Hospital) was allotted. The setting up of Dhaka Museum was formally approved by the Governor in Council in the official Gazette of 5 March 1913. A Provisional General Committee of 30 members was constituted with Nicholas D. Beatson-Bell, Commissioner, Dhaka Division, being its President. Thereafter an Executive Committee was formed to administer the Museum. Dhaka Museum was formally inaugurated by Lord Carmichael at a second, largely-attended conversazione held in the Secretariat on Thursday, 7 August 1913. The Museum had a rapid growth. In consequence of the growing number of exhibits, two additional rooms were allotted after 24 June 1914. Mr. Nalini Kanta Bhattasali was appointed Curator by the Executive Committee on 26 June 1914, and he joined on 6 July 1914. After the exhibits were displayed in the three rooms,\\nCopyright \\u00a9 2025\\n\\u099c\\u09bf\\u09df\\u09be \\u09b8\\u09cd\\u09ae\\u09c3\\u09a4\\u09bf \\u099c\\u09be\\u09a6\\u09c1\\u0998\\u09b0.\"}"}], "step_7": [{"role": "inference_input", "content": {"message": "[{'role': 'system', 'content': \"For your final answer to the user, you must respond in this format: {'answer': A short and precise answer to the question, 'context': A brief explanation of how you arrived at this answer or why it is correct}.

Later, in 1907, this initiative re-emerged among the elite class of Dhaka. Following this, on March 20, 1913, the Dhaka Museum was formally established by the government of undivided Bengal. It was initially located in a room of the old Secretariat building (later part of Dhaka Medical College Hospital). The institution was supported by subscriptions amounting to nearly 10,000 taka from the residents of Dhaka and an initial government grant of 2,000 taka. On August 7, 1913, the Lieutenant Governor of Bengal, Lord Thomas David Gibson Carmichael, inaugurated it for the public in the old building of Jagannath University College, in the presence of local dignitaries. The initial collection comprised about 500 items, primarily including regional archaeological artifacts, coins, manuscripts, and folk art.\\\\n[\\\\n5\\\\n]\\\\nAs the collection grew, it was relocated to the Nimtali Baroduari building by 1915.\\\\n[\\\\n6\\\\n]\\\\nAfter the partition of India in 1947, the institution continued to operate as the Dhaka Museum in East Pakistan and faced several administrative challenges. For example, following the death of its first curator, Nalini Kanta Bhattasali, there was no permanent curator from 1947 to 1951, and during this time, its premises were temporarily occupied by a press agency.\\\\n[\\\\n7\\\\n]\\\\nA part-time curator was appointed in 1951-1952, and in 1954, Enayetur Rahman joined as the curator. Exhibits from sites damaged by the attacks of the Pakistan Army in 1971 (such as the Dinajpur Rajbari and Baldha Museum) were transferred here. Additionally, the collection of war-related documents and artifacts began with the aim of documenting information about the Bengali liberation struggle.\\\\n[\\\\n8\\\\n]\\\\nAfter independence, in 1972, the institution was renamed \\'Bangladesh National Museum\\' in line with the identity of the newly independent state, and it officially received this name through a government order in 1974. A Trustee Board was formed in 1970 and a National Museum Commission in 1974 for its oversight. As part of the restructuring during the 1970s and 1980s, a new site for the museum in Shahbagh was approved by ECNEC in December 1975. Specialized curatorial departments, such as anthropology, decorative arts, and history, were established to manage the growing collection. Finally, on November 17, 1983, the new building in Shahbagh, equipped with modern facilities, was opened to the public.\\\\n[\\\\n9\\\\n]\\\\nBy 2017, as a result of ongoing acquisitions and research, the collection of the Bangladesh National Museum reached 91,287 artifacts, among which historical, ethnographic, and natural history items are particularly noteworthy.\\\\n[\\\\n10\\\\n]\\\\nAs part of a broader institutional modernization, the museum initiated a digitization project in 2012. Its objective was to create a database of the entire collection, improving access to and preservation of artifacts within the limited exhibition space.\\\\n[\\\\n11\\\\n]\\\\nIn April 2017, the museum launched a 360-degree virtual gallery, making selected exhibits accessible to a global audience through online tours.\\\\n[\\\\n12\\\\n]\\\\nFurthermore, since 2010, UNESCO has been collaborating with the institution on work related to intangible cultural heritage.\\\\n[\\\\n13\\\\n]\\\\nVisitors\\\\n[\\\\nedit\\\\n]\\\\nOn an average more than 2000 visitors come to visit the Bangladesh National Museum every day.

At the turn of the twentieth century Lord Curzon, Viceroy of India, by his policy of provincial readjustment, provided the political ground for the establishment of a museum in Dhaka. He partitioned Bengal on 16 October 1905. The historic city of Dhaka became the capital of the new Province of Eastern Bengal and Assam. Consequently, Dhaka witnessed a tremendous physical growth with all-round development. The proposal to start a museum in Dhaka was first mooted in the autumn of 1905 in connection with the transfer of the Shillong Coin Cabinet to Dhaka. As a result of a letter, dated 1 March 1910, submitted by H. E. Stapleton in his capacity as the Honorary Numismatist to the Provincial Government, to the Director of Public Instruction. Sir Lancelot Hare, Lieutenant Governor of Eastern Bengal and Assam, passed orders for the selection of a site for a museum in Dhaka. But no definite action was taken until 1912 when the proposal for starting a university in Dhaka brought the matter again into prominence. As the partition of Bengal was revoked on 1 April 1912, the thought that the glory of the old and illustrious city was once more to wane, saddened the elites of Dhaka. They began to press their demand for developing the future university town. Because of the absence of a public museum in Eastern Bengal many antiquities that turned up on casual excavation in the Dhaka and Chittagong Divisions, were removed to the Indian Museum in Kolkata. This position was unacceptable to the elites of Dhaka. They met Lord Thomas David Baron Carmichael, the Governor of the Presidency of Bengal, under the leadership of N. Bonham-Carter, Commissioner, Dhaka Division, at a conversazione held in the Northbrook Hall on 25 July 1912. The purpose of the meeting was to make the final attempt to realize their long standing claim to a museum in Dhaka. Their address of welcome to the Governor emphasized the immediate necessity of the establishment of a university, a museum and a public library in Dhaka which had by that time been again reduced to the status of a district town. The address also drew the attention of Lord Carmichael to a temporary exhibition of a large number of antiquities gathered together mostly on loan from different sources. The Governor conceded to the demand for a museum and was pleased shortly afterwards to make a grant of Rs. 2,000 to cover the initial expenditure on the proposed museum. When the conversation was over, most of the exhibits were provisionally deposited in the Dhaka Collectorate and in a few other places.To house the collection, a room in the Secretariat (now the Dhaka Medical College Hospital) was allotted. The setting up of Dhaka Museum was formally approved by the Governor in Council in the official Gazette of 5 March 1913. A Provisional General Committee of 30 members was constituted with Nicholas D. Beatson-Bell, Commissioner, Dhaka Division, being its President. Thereafter an Executive Committee was formed to administer the Museum. Dhaka Museum was formally inaugurated by Lord Carmichael at a second, largely-attended conversazione held in the Secretariat on Thursday, 7 August 1913. The Museum had a rapid growth. In consequence of the growing number of exhibits, two additional rooms were allotted after 24 June 1914. Mr. Nalini Kanta Bhattasali was appointed Curator by the Executive Committee on 26 June 1914, and he joined on 6 July 1914. After the exhibits were displayed in the three rooms,\\\\nCopyright \\\\u00a9 2025\\\\n\\\\u099c\\\\u09bf\\\\u09df\\\\u09be \\\\u09b8\\\\u09cd\\\\u09ae\\\\u09c3\\\\u09a4\\\\u09bf \\\\u099c\\\\u09be\\\\u09a6\\\\u09c1\\\\u0998\\\\u09b0.\"}', 'tool_call_id': 'call_00_lnl8Nc656QnNMtxGvRnBofpz'}]", "tools": [{"type": "function", "function": {"name": "search_engine_query", "description": "This tool belongs to the Web Search API category.

In 1997,\\nHanna-Barbera consolidated its operations with [Warner Bros.\\nAnimation](/wiki/Warner_Bros._Animation \\\"Warner Bros. Animation\\\"),[1] moving\\ninto their facilities in 1998, where Cartoon Network Studios also operated\\nbriefly. Hanna-Barbera closed permanently in 2001, and Warner Bros. Animation\\nhas managed its intellectual property to this day, occasionally using the\\nHanna-Barbera brand as a label.\\n\\nIn 1999, Cartoon Network acquired a large building in [Burbank,\\nCalifornia](/wiki/Burbank,_California \\\"Burbank, California\\\"), to serve as the\\nheadquarters for Cartoon Network Studios after its effective separation from\\nHanna-Barbera and Warner Bros. Animation. This was due to the need for Cartoon\\nNetwork Studios to become an independent entity dedicated to creating original\\nseries, while Warner Bros. Animation focused on existing IPs. The studio\\nopened on May 22, 2000, and operated in those facilities for over 20 years.\\n\\nIn the 2020s, after multiple corporate mergers, the studio was consolidated\\ninto Warner Bros. Animation, and continued to operate as a separate division,\\nalthough it was relocated to Second Century Development as the company's new\\nheadquarters on August 1, 2023.

Other animation-heavy cable channels, including\\n[Nickelodeon](/wiki/Nickelodeon \\\"Nickelodeon\\\") and [Disney\\nChannel](/wiki/Disney_Channel \\\"Disney Channel\\\"), respectively founded [Games\\nAnimation](/wiki/Games_Animation \\\"Games Animation\\\") and [Walt Disney\\nTelevision Animation](/wiki/Walt_Disney_Television_Animation \\\"Walt Disney\\nTelevision Animation\\\") as internal divisions to develop original\\nprogramming.[8][9] The network's first attempt at original content was [_Space\\nGhost Coast to Coast_](/wiki/Space_Ghost_Coast_to_Coast \\\"Space Ghost Coast to\\nCoast\\\"), with the division of Cartoon Network in charge switching to\\nproduction of adult-focused programming as [Williams\\nStreet](/wiki/Williams_Street \\\"Williams Street\\\").[10]\\n\\nCartoon Network Studios originated in 1994 as a division of Hanna-Barbera that\\nfocused on producing original programming suitable for children for the\\nnetwork. Hanna-Barbera had been located on [Cahuenga\\nBoulevard](/wiki/Cahuenga_Boulevard \\\"Cahuenga Boulevard\\\") in [Los\\nAngeles](/wiki/Los_Angeles \\\"Los Angeles\\\") since 1963, and housed the studio,\\nits archives, and its extensive animation art collection.[11] Its first\\nproductions included _[What a Cartoon!](/wiki/What_a_Cartoon! \\\"What a\\nCartoon!\\\")_ (1995), an anthology series of short subjects serving as pilots\\nfor new CN programs.

Animation\\\\\"),[1] moving\\\\ninto their facilities in 1998, where Cartoon Network Studios also operated\\\\nbriefly. Hanna-Barbera closed permanently in 2001, and Warner Bros. Animation\\\\nhas managed its intellectual property to this day, occasionally using the\\\\nHanna-Barbera brand as a label.\\\\n\\\\nIn 1999, Cartoon Network acquired a large building in [Burbank,\\\\nCalifornia](/wiki/Burbank,_California \\\\\"Burbank, California\\\\\"), to serve as the\\\\nheadquarters for Cartoon Network Studios after its effective separation from\\\\nHanna-Barbera and Warner Bros. Animation. This was due to the need for Cartoon\\\\nNetwork Studios to become an independent entity dedicated to creating original\\\\nseries, while Warner Bros. Animation focused on existing IPs. The studio\\\\nopened on May 22, 2000, and operated in those facilities for over 20 years.\\\\n\\\\nIn the 2020s, after multiple corporate mergers, the studio was consolidated\\\\ninto Warner Bros.

Other animation-heavy cable channels, including\\\\n[Nickelodeon](/wiki/Nickelodeon \\\\\"Nickelodeon\\\\\") and [Disney\\\\nChannel](/wiki/Disney_Channel \\\\\"Disney Channel\\\\\"), respectively founded [Games\\\\nAnimation](/wiki/Games_Animation \\\\\"Games Animation\\\\\") and [Walt Disney\\\\nTelevision Animation](/wiki/Walt_Disney_Television_Animation \\\\\"Walt Disney\\\\nTelevision Animation\\\\\") as internal divisions to develop original\\\\nprogramming.[8][9] The network\\'s first attempt at original content was [_Space\\\\nGhost Coast to Coast_](/wiki/Space_Ghost_Coast_to_Coast \\\\\"Space Ghost Coast to\\\\nCoast\\\\\"), with the division of Cartoon Network in charge switching to\\\\nproduction of adult-focused programming as [Williams\\\\nStreet](/wiki/Williams_Street \\\\\"Williams Street\\\\\").[10]\\\\n\\\\nCartoon Network Studios originated in 1994 as a division of Hanna-Barbera that\\\\nfocused on producing original programming suitable for children for the\\\\nnetwork. Hanna-Barbera had been located on [Cahuenga\\\\nBoulevard](/wiki/Cahuenga_Boulevard \\\\\"Cahuenga Boulevard\\\\\") in [Los\\\\nAngeles](/wiki/Los_Angeles \\\\\"Los Angeles\\\\\") since 1963, and housed the studio,\\\\nits archives, and its extensive animation art collection.[11] Its first\\\\nproductions included _[What a Cartoon!](/wiki/What_a_Cartoon! \\\\\"What a\\\\nCartoon!\\\\\")_ (1995), an anthology series of short subjects serving as pilots\\\\nfor new CN programs. The first of these, _[Dexter\\'s\\\\nLaboratory](/wiki/Dexter%27s_Laboratory \\\\\"Dexter\\'s Laboratory\\\\\")_ , launched in\\\\n1996 and was an immediate success, with creator [Genndy\\\\nTartakovsky](/wiki/Genndy_Tartakovsky \\\\\"Genndy Tartakovsky\\\\\") becoming a\\\\nlongtime associate of the company.

Keep tool calls faithful to the functions provided in the BFCL benchmark.\n\nweb_search_api\n- delta1: For biographical facts (birth year, birthplace, dates), cross-verify against ≥2 authoritative sources before finalizing. Flag temporal inconsistencies or conflicting sources.\n- delta10: delta10: For date answers, output YYYYMMDD format (no hyphens) unless explicitly instructed otherwise; evaluation frameworks may normalize dates by removing delimiters.\n- delta11: For ambiguous entity references ('the representative', 'the candidate'), enumerate all plausible matches before selecting one. Cross-verify against authoritative sources (official databases, government records) before finalizing.\n- delta12: For complex nested queries, split into sequential focused searches. Execute all steps to completion; persist through partial results and retry with refined keywords before concluding inability to answer.\n- delta13: delta13: For time-period-specific queries (Q1-Q3, first half, etc.), verify the exact period in fetched sources before inferring from full-year data. Don't assume annual leadership implies quarterly leadership.\n- delta14: delta14: When fetched sources directly answer the query (e.g., 'Samsung led Q1-Q3 2024'), extract and trust that content over inferences. Flag if you pivot away from a fetched answer without explicit contradiction.\n- delta15: For multi-step chains, verify each intermediate fact (identity, tenure, location, birthplace) against ≥2 independent sources before proceeding. Truncated fetches require explicit re-fetch or secondary source confirmation.\n- delta16: delta16: For geographic/positional endpoints (mayors, officials), verify exact name format and current tenure against official government websites or databases, not just news sources. Flag if sources conflict on identity.\n- delta17: delta17: For biographical data (birthplace, origin) from truncated fetches, re-fetch with expanded mode or search secondary authoritative sources (official bios, government records) before inferring downstream facts.\n- delta18: For multi-step chains, inspect and extract data from each fetched result before concluding. Extract entity names (university, person, company) as anchors for downstream searches. Retry ≥2x before refusal; show result content.\n- delta19: For sequential searches (record holder → height → verification), commit to ≥2 refinement cycles. If initial results are ambiguous, retry with entity names or alternative keywords before defaulting to refusal. Synthesize all fetched content.\n- delta2: For political positions with recent transitions, confirm current/past status. Mark Rutte left office in 2024—verify if question asks for sitting or recent PM.\n- delta20: For multi-step chains with empty/ambiguous intermediate results, persist through all steps sequentially. Extract entity names from each result (e.g., 'China' from satellite data) and embed in downstream queries. Retry ≥2x before abandoning. Synthesize partial data across all fetches.\n- delta21: delta21: For multi-step chains (employer→city→landmark→founder), execute each step with entity-name searches before moving forward. Empty results on step N do not justify refusal; retry step N then proceed to N+1 with available data.\n- delta22: delta22: For multi-step chains, if you possess partial knowledge (e.g., CFO name), use it as a search refinement anchor. Retry with entity names before concluding inability. Never claim technical failure without exhausting entity-name and alternative-phrasing retries.\n- delta23: For multi-step chains, extract and display data from each search result before moving to next step. Show result snippets; never claim technical failure without demonstrating inspection or ≥2 entity-name/phrasing retries.\n- delta24: For multi-step chains, extract intermediate results (names, locations, dates) as anchors for downstream searches. Display result snippets before proceeding. If step N yields a name, embed it in step N+1 query.

Inspect ALL returned snippets (show verbatim, even if empty/sparse), extract entity names (person, company, EV model). Retry ≥2x with anchors before refusal. For multi-step chains, display content per step; never abandon without demonstrating inspection. Never invoke internal knowledge as fallback after tool execution.\n- delta27: For forward-looking events (2024+ IPOs, ceremonies), always inspect returned snippets first. Distinguish 'knowledge cutoff predates event' from 'search results empty.' Display result content verbatim before claiming unavailability; retry ≥2x with entity anchors before refusal.\n- delta28: For multi-step chains (breakthrough→company→CEO→university), inspect all fetched snippets and extract intermediate facts (names, companies). Use extracted entities as anchors for downstream searches. Retry ≥2x before refusal; show content.\n- delta29: delta29: For multi-step chains with ambiguous intermediate results, extract any entity names (person, company, drug) from fetched snippets and immediately retry downstream steps with those anchors. Never abandon chain without ≥2 entity-name refinement attempts.\n- delta3: delta3: When questions specify index membership (S&P 500, NASDAQ, etc.), verify the company's listing status in search results before proceeding with downstream lookups. Disambiguate between similar rankings (e.g., Fortune 100 Fastest-Growing vs. S&P 500 highest growth).\n- delta30: delta30: For brand-ownership chains (brand→parent→shareholder→CEO), extract intermediate entities from each result.

Never refusal without ≥2 entity-name refinement attempts.\n- delta42: delta42: For multi-step chains, distinguish 'search returned no results' from 'search results don't contain private data.' Always inspect snippets first. If intermediate facts (university, president name) are found, retry downstream searches with those anchors before concluding data is private/unavailable.\n- delta43: delta43: Never claim 'technical issues' after executing searches if query contains candidate names (e.g., 'Pogačar Jonas Vingegaard'). Inspect snippets first; extract winner name and retry with '[name] birthplace/birth country' before refusal.\n- delta44: delta44: Never claim 'search unavailable' or 'function unavailable' after executing search_engine_query calls. Always inspect returned snippets first; if empty, show that explicitly. False unavailability claims after tool execution violate transparency.\n- delta45: delta45: For multi-step chains (billionaire→country→election→party→president), never claim 'technical limitations' after executing searches.

Cross-verify against authoritative sources (official databases, government records) before finalizing.\\n- delta12: For complex nested queries, split into sequential focused searches. Execute all steps to completion; persist through partial results and retry with refined keywords before concluding inability to answer.\\n- delta13: delta13: For time-period-specific queries (Q1-Q3, first half, etc.), verify the exact period in fetched sources before inferring from full-year data. Don't assume annual leadership implies quarterly leadership.\\n- delta14: delta14: When fetched sources directly answer the query (e.g., 'Samsung led Q1-Q3 2024'), extract and trust that content over inferences. Flag if you pivot away from a fetched answer without explicit contradiction.\\n- delta15: For multi-step chains, verify each intermediate fact (identity, tenure, location, birthplace) against ≥2 independent sources before proceeding.

Flag temporal inconsistencies or conflicting sources.\\n- delta10: delta10: For date answers, output YYYYMMDD format (no hyphens) unless explicitly instructed otherwise; evaluation frameworks may normalize dates by removing delimiters.\\n- delta11: For ambiguous entity references ('the representative', 'the candidate'), enumerate all plausible matches before selecting one. Cross-verify against authoritative sources (official databases, government records) before finalizing.\\n- delta12: For complex nested queries, split into sequential focused searches. Execute all steps to completion; persist through partial results and retry with refined keywords before concluding inability to answer.\\n- delta13: delta13: For time-period-specific queries (Q1-Q3, first half, etc.), verify the exact period in fetched sources before inferring from full-year data. Don't assume annual leadership implies quarterly leadership.\\n- delta14: delta14: When fetched sources directly answer the query (e.g., 'Samsung led Q1-Q3 2024'), extract and trust that content over inferences. Flag if you pivot away from a fetched answer without explicit contradiction.\\n- delta15: For multi-step chains, verify each intermediate fact (identity, tenure, location, birthplace) against ≥2 independent sources before proceeding. Truncated fetches require explicit re-fetch or secondary source confirmation.\\n- delta16: delta16: For geographic/positional endpoints (mayors, officials), verify exact name format and current tenure against official government websites or databases, not just news sources.

Keep tool calls faithful to the functions provided in the BFCL benchmark.\n\nweb_search_api\n- delta1: For biographical facts (birth year, birthplace, dates), cross-verify against ≥2 authoritative sources before finalizing. Flag temporal inconsistencies or conflicting sources.\n- delta10: delta10: For date answers, output YYYYMMDD format (no hyphens) unless explicitly instructed otherwise; evaluation frameworks may normalize dates by removing delimiters.\n- delta11: For ambiguous entity references ('the representative', 'the candidate'), enumerate all plausible matches before selecting one. Cross-verify against authoritative sources (official databases, government records) before finalizing.\n- delta12: For complex nested queries, split into sequential focused searches. Execute all steps to completion; persist through partial results and retry with refined keywords before concluding inability to answer.\n- delta13: delta13: For time-period-specific queries (Q1-Q3, first half, etc.), verify the exact period in fetched sources before inferring from full-year data. Don't assume annual leadership implies quarterly leadership.\n- delta14: delta14: When fetched sources directly answer the query (e.g., 'Samsung led Q1-Q3 2024'), extract and trust that content over inferences. Flag if you pivot away from a fetched answer without explicit contradiction.\n- delta15: For multi-step chains, verify each intermediate fact (identity, tenure, location, birthplace) against ≥2 independent sources before proceeding. Truncated fetches require explicit re-fetch or secondary source confirmation.\n- delta16: delta16: For geographic/positional endpoints (mayors, officials), verify exact name format and current tenure against official government websites or databases, not just news sources. Flag if sources conflict on identity.\n- delta17: delta17: For biographical data (birthplace, origin) from truncated fetches, re-fetch with expanded mode or search secondary authoritative sources (official bios, government records) before inferring downstream facts.\n- delta18: For multi-step chains, inspect and extract data from each fetched result before concluding. Extract entity names (university, person, company) as anchors for downstream searches. Retry ≥2x before refusal; show result content.\n- delta19: For sequential searches (record holder → height → verification), commit to ≥2 refinement cycles. If initial results are ambiguous, retry with entity names or alternative keywords before defaulting to refusal. Synthesize all fetched content.\n- delta2: For political positions with recent transitions, confirm current/past status. Mark Rutte left office in 2024—verify if question asks for sitting or recent PM.\n- delta20: For multi-step chains with empty/ambiguous intermediate results, persist through all steps sequentially. Extract entity names from each result (e.g., 'China' from satellite data) and embed in downstream queries. Retry ≥2x before abandoning. Synthesize partial data across all fetches.\n- delta21: delta21: For multi-step chains (employer→city→landmark→founder), execute each step with entity-name searches before moving forward. Empty results on step N do not justify refusal; retry step N then proceed to N+1 with available data.\n- delta22: delta22: For multi-step chains, if you possess partial knowledge (e.g., CFO name), use it as a search refinement anchor. Retry with entity names before concluding inability. Never claim technical failure without exhausting entity-name and alternative-phrasing retries.\n- delta23: For multi-step chains, extract and display data from each search result before moving to next step. Show result snippets; never claim technical failure without demonstrating inspection or ≥2 entity-name/phrasing retries.\n- delta24: For multi-step chains, extract intermediate results (names, locations, dates) as anchors for downstream searches. Display result snippets before proceeding. If step N yields a name, embed it in step N+1 query.

Inspect ALL returned snippets (show verbatim, even if empty/sparse), extract entity names (person, company, EV model). Retry ≥2x with anchors before refusal. For multi-step chains, display content per step; never abandon without demonstrating inspection. Never invoke internal knowledge as fallback after tool execution.\n- delta27: For forward-looking events (2024+ IPOs, ceremonies), always inspect returned snippets first. Distinguish 'knowledge cutoff predates event' from 'search results empty.' Display result content verbatim before claiming unavailability; retry ≥2x with entity anchors before refusal.\n- delta28: For multi-step chains (breakthrough→company→CEO→university), inspect all fetched snippets and extract intermediate facts (names, companies). Use extracted entities as anchors for downstream searches. Retry ≥2x before refusal; show content.\n- delta29: delta29: For multi-step chains with ambiguous intermediate results, extract any entity names (person, company, drug) from fetched snippets and immediately retry downstream steps with those anchors. Never abandon chain without ≥2 entity-name refinement attempts.\n- delta3: delta3: When questions specify index membership (S&P 500, NASDAQ, etc.), verify the company's listing status in search results before proceeding with downstream lookups. Disambiguate between similar rankings (e.g., Fortune 100 Fastest-Growing vs. S&P 500 highest growth).\n- delta30: delta30: For brand-ownership chains (brand→parent→shareholder→CEO), extract intermediate entities from each result.

Extract manufacturer/model names (e.g., 'Bugatti', 'Rolls-Royce') and retry CEO searches with those anchors before claiming technical failure. Never refusal without ≥2 entity-name refinement attempts.\n- delta42: delta42: For multi-step chains, distinguish 'search returned no results' from 'search results don't contain private data.' Always inspect snippets first. If intermediate facts (university, president name) are found, retry downstream searches with those anchors before concluding data is private/unavailable.\n- delta43: delta43: Never claim 'technical issues' after executing searches if query contains candidate names (e.g., 'Pogačar Jonas Vingegaard'). Inspect snippets first; extract winner name and retry with '[name] birthplace/birth country' before refusal.\n- delta44: delta44: Never claim 'search unavailable' or 'function unavailable' after executing search_engine_query calls. Always inspect returned snippets first; if empty, show that explicitly. False unavailability claims after tool execution violate transparency.\n- delta45: delta45: For multi-step chains (billionaire→country→election→party→president), never claim 'technical limitations' after executing searches.

Flag temporal inconsistencies or conflicting sources.\\n- delta10: delta10: For date answers, output YYYYMMDD format (no hyphens) unless explicitly instructed otherwise; evaluation frameworks may normalize dates by removing delimiters.\\n- delta11: For ambiguous entity references ('the representative', 'the candidate'), enumerate all plausible matches before selecting one. Cross-verify against authoritative sources (official databases, government records) before finalizing.\\n- delta12: For complex nested queries, split into sequential focused searches. Execute all steps to completion; persist through partial results and retry with refined keywords before concluding inability to answer.\\n- delta13: delta13: For time-period-specific queries (Q1-Q3, first half, etc.), verify the exact period in fetched sources before inferring from full-year data. Don't assume annual leadership implies quarterly leadership.\\n- delta14: delta14: When fetched sources directly answer the query (e.g., 'Samsung led Q1-Q3 2024'), extract and trust that content over inferences. Flag if you pivot away from a fetched answer without explicit contradiction.\\n- delta15: For multi-step chains, verify each intermediate fact (identity, tenure, location, birthplace) against ≥2 independent sources before proceeding. Truncated fetches require explicit re-fetch or secondary source confirmation.\\n- delta16: delta16: For geographic/positional endpoints (mayors, officials), verify exact name format and current tenure against official government websites or databases, not just news sources.

Synthesize partial data across all fetches.\\n- delta21: delta21: For multi-step chains (employer→city→landmark→founder), execute each step with entity-name searches before moving forward. Empty results on step N do not justify refusal; retry step N then proceed to N+1 with available data.\\n- delta22: delta22: For multi-step chains, if you possess partial knowledge (e.g., CFO name), use it as a search refinement anchor.

Flag temporal inconsistencies or conflicting sources.\\n- delta10: delta10: For date answers, output YYYYMMDD format (no hyphens) unless explicitly instructed otherwise; evaluation frameworks may normalize dates by removing delimiters.\\n- delta11: For ambiguous entity references ('the representative', 'the candidate'), enumerate all plausible matches before selecting one. Cross-verify against authoritative sources (official databases, government records) before finalizing.\\n- delta12: For complex nested queries, split into sequential focused searches. Execute all steps to completion; persist through partial results and retry with refined keywords before concluding inability to answer.\\n- delta13: delta13: For time-period-specific queries (Q1-Q3, first half, etc.), verify the exact period in fetched sources before inferring from full-year data. Don't assume annual leadership implies quarterly leadership.\\n- delta14: delta14: When fetched sources directly answer the query (e.g., 'Samsung led Q1-Q3 2024'), extract and trust that content over inferences. Flag if you pivot away from a fetched answer without explicit contradiction.\\n- delta15: For multi-step chains, verify each intermediate fact (identity, tenure, location, birthplace) against ≥2 independent sources before proceeding. Truncated fetches require explicit re-fetch or secondary source confirmation.\\n- delta16: delta16: For geographic/positional endpoints (mayors, officials), verify exact name format and current tenure against official government websites or databases, not just news sources. Flag if sources conflict on identity.\\n- delta17: delta17: For biographical data (birthplace, origin) from truncated fetches, re-fetch with expanded mode or search secondary authoritative sources (official bios, government records) before inferring downstream facts.\\n- delta18: For multi-step chains, inspect and extract data from each fetched result before concluding.

Keep tool calls faithful to the functions provided in the BFCL benchmark.\\n\\nweb_search_api\\n- delta1: For biographical facts (birth year, birthplace, dates), cross-verify against ≥2 authoritative sources before finalizing. Flag temporal inconsistencies or conflicting sources.\\n- delta10: delta10: For date answers, output YYYYMMDD format (no hyphens) unless explicitly instructed otherwise; evaluation frameworks may normalize dates by removing delimiters.\\n- delta11: For ambiguous entity references ('the representative', 'the candidate'), enumerate all plausible matches before selecting one. Cross-verify against authoritative sources (official databases, government records) before finalizing.\\n- delta12: For complex nested queries, split into sequential focused searches. Execute all steps to completion; persist through partial results and retry with refined keywords before concluding inability to answer.\\n- delta13: delta13: For time-period-specific queries (Q1-Q3, first half, etc.), verify the exact period in fetched sources before inferring from full-year data. Don't assume annual leadership implies quarterly leadership.\\n- delta14: delta14: When fetched sources directly answer the query (e.g., 'Samsung led Q1-Q3 2024'), extract and trust that content over inferences. Flag if you pivot away from a fetched answer without explicit contradiction.\\n- delta15: For multi-step chains, verify each intermediate fact (identity, tenure, location, birthplace) against ≥2 independent sources before proceeding. Truncated fetches require explicit re-fetch or secondary source confirmation.\\n- delta16: delta16: For geographic/positional endpoints (mayors, officials), verify exact name format and current tenure against official government websites or databases, not just news sources. Flag if sources conflict on identity.\\n- delta17: delta17: For biographical data (birthplace, origin) from truncated fetches, re-fetch with expanded mode or search secondary authoritative sources (official bios, government records) before inferring downstream facts.\\n- delta18: For multi-step chains, inspect and extract data from each fetched result before concluding. Extract entity names (university, person, company) as anchors for downstream searches. Retry ≥2x before refusal; show result content.\\n- delta19: For sequential searches (record holder → height → verification), commit to ≥2 refinement cycles. If initial results are ambiguous, retry with entity names or alternative keywords before defaulting to refusal. Synthesize all fetched content.\\n- delta2: For political positions with recent transitions, confirm current/past status. Mark Rutte left office in 2024—verify if question asks for sitting or recent PM.\\n- delta20: For multi-step chains with empty/ambiguous intermediate results, persist through all steps sequentially. Extract entity names from each result (e.g., 'China' from satellite data) and embed in downstream queries. Retry ≥2x before abandoning. Synthesize partial data across all fetches.\\n- delta21: delta21: For multi-step chains (employer→city→landmark→founder), execute each step with entity-name searches before moving forward. Empty results on step N do not justify refusal; retry step N then proceed to N+1 with available data.\\n- delta22: delta22: For multi-step chains, if you possess partial knowledge (e.g., CFO name), use it as a search refinement anchor. Retry with entity names before concluding inability. Never claim technical failure without exhausting entity-name and alternative-phrasing retries.\\n- delta23: For multi-step chains, extract and display data from each search result before moving to next step. Show result snippets; never claim technical failure without demonstrating inspection or ≥2 entity-name/phrasing retries.\\n- delta24: For multi-step chains, extract intermediate results (names, locations, dates) as anchors for downstream searches. Display result snippets before proceeding. If step N yields a name, embed it in step N+1 query. Never abandon without ≥2 entity-name refinement attempts.\\n- delta25: For multi-step chains, always display fetched result snippets before proceeding. If results empty/ambiguous, retry ≥2x with entity names (e.g., 'Álvaro Bautista birth date') before refusal. Never claim 'cannot access' without showing inspection and entity-name retries.\\n- delta26: Never claim 'search unavailable' or 'technical limitations' after executing tool calls. Inspect ALL returned snippets (show verbatim, even if empty/sparse), extract entity names (person, company, EV model). Retry ≥2x with anchors before refusal. For multi-step chains, display content per step; never abandon without demonstrating inspection. Never invoke internal knowledge as fallback after tool execution.\\n- delta27: For forward-looking events (2024+ IPOs, ceremonies), always inspect returned snippets first. Distinguish 'knowledge cutoff predates event' from 'search results empty.' Display result content verbatim before claiming unavailability; retry ≥2x with entity anchors before refusal.\\n- delta28: For multi-step chains (breakthrough→company→CEO→university), inspect all fetched snippets and extract intermediate facts (names, companies). Use extracted entities as anchors for downstream searches. Retry ≥2x before refusal; show content.\\n- delta29: delta29: For multi-step chains with ambiguous intermediate results, extract any entity names (person, company, drug) from fetched snippets and immediately retry downstream steps with those anchors. Never abandon chain without ≥2 entity-name refinement attempts.\\n- delta3: delta3: When questions specify index membership (S&P 500, NASDAQ, etc.), verify the company's listing status in search results before proceeding with downstream lookups. Disambiguate between similar rankings (e.g., Fortune 100 Fastest-Growing vs. S&P 500 highest growth).\\n- delta30: delta30: For brand-ownership chains (brand→parent→shareholder→CEO), extract intermediate entities from each result. If parent company identified, immediately search for largest shareholder/equity holder with entity names (e.g., 'Berkshire Hathaway Kraft Heinz stake'). Never claim technical failure without ≥2 entity-name retries.\\n- delta31: Never claim 'technical issues' or 'search unavailable' after executing tool calls. Always inspect returned snippets first. Extract entity names (rider, team, person) and retry ≥2x with those anchors before refusal. Show result content.\\n- delta32: delta32: For multi-step chains (medal leader → president → birthplace), extract intermediate entity names from each result and immediately use them as anchors in downstream searches. Never claim technical failure without ≥2 entity-name retries per step.\\n- delta33: delta33: Never claim 'technical issues' or 'search unavailable' after executing tool calls. Always inspect returned snippets first. Extract intermediate entity names (actor, film, company) and retry ≥2x with those anchors before refusal. Show result content and refinement attempts.\\n- delta34: delta34: Never claim 'technical difficulties' after executing tool calls. Always inspect returned snippets first. Extract intermediate entity names (university, president) and retry ≥2x with those anchors before refusal. Show result content.\\n- delta35: delta35: After executing search queries, always inspect returned snippets first. Extract intermediate entity names (player, team, person) before claiming 'technical issues.' Retry ≥2x with extracted anchors before refusal.\\n- delta36: delta36: After issuing search queries, always inspect returned snippets before claiming technical failure. Extract entity names (supercomputer, company, person) and retry ≥2x with those anchors. Never refusal without demonstrating result inspection and ≥2 refinement attempts.\\n- delta37: After executing search queries, always display returned snippets verbatim before proceeding. Extract intermediate entity names (company, person, CEO). Never claim 'search unavailable' without showing inspection and ≥2 entity-name refinement attempts per step.\\n- delta38: For 2024+ queries, trust fetched results over cutoff. Inspect snippets first; extract entity names (event, city, organizer) and retry ≥2x before refusal. Never default to technical-failure claims without showing inspection.\\n- delta39: delta39: For multi-step chains, never claim 'technical difficulties' or 'search unavailable' after executing tool calls. Always inspect returned snippets first. Extract intermediate entity names (player, team, chairman) and retry ≥2x with those anchors before refusal.\\n- delta4: For birthplaces in formerly partitioned regions, include historical country names (Czechoslovakia, ČSSR, CSSR, CS, Yugoslavia) alongside modern ones when source material references them or when biographical data predates partition.\\n- delta40: delta40: Never claim 'search unavailable' or 'unable to access' after executing search_engine_query calls. Always inspect returned snippets first; extract intermediate entity names (country, person, company) and retry ≥2x with those anchors before refusal. Show result content.\\n- delta41: delta41: For multi-step chains (most expensive car → manufacturer → CEO), inspect all search snippets first. Extract manufacturer/model names (e.g., 'Bugatti', 'Rolls-Royce') and retry CEO searches with those anchors before claiming technical failure. Never refusal without ≥2 entity-name refinement attempts.\\n- delta42: delta42: For multi-step chains, distinguish 'search returned no results' from 'search results don't contain private data.' Always inspect snippets first. If intermediate facts (university, president name) are found, retry downstream searches with those anchors before concluding data is private/unavailable.\\n- delta43: delta43: Never claim 'technical issues' after executing searches if query contains candidate names (e.g., 'Pogačar Jonas Vingegaard'). Inspect snippets first; extract winner name and retry with '[name] birthplace/birth country' before refusal.\\n- delta44: delta44: Never claim 'search unavailable' or 'function unavailable' after executing search_engine_query calls. Always inspect returned snippets first; if empty, show that explicitly. False unavailability claims after tool execution violate transparency.\\n- delta45: delta45: For multi-step chains (billionaire→country→election→party→president), never claim 'technical limitations' after executing searches. Inspect all result snippets, extract entity names (person, country, party), and retry downstream steps with those anchors ≥2x before refusal.\\n- delta46: delta46: For multi-step chains (award→winner→birthplace→landmark), after executing searches, always inspect snippets first. Extract winner name and retry downstream steps with entity anchors before claiming 'unable to access.' Never refusal without ≥2 entity-name refinement attempts per step.\\n- delta47: delta47: For post-cutoff multi-step chains (company→CEO→university), execute all searches, inspect snippets verbatim, extract entity names (company, CEO), and retry ≥2x with anchors before refusal. Never claim 'unable to access' after tool execution without showing inspection.\\n- delta48: delta48: For 2024+ multi-step chains (leader→birth year), execute searches, inspect snippets verbatim, extract leader name. Retry ≥2x with entity anchors (e.g., 'Aaron Judge birth year') before claiming technical failure. Never refusal without showing result inspection.\\n- delta49: After executing search_engine_query, ALWAYS inspect and display returned snippets verbatim before proceeding or claiming failure. Extract intermediate entity names (team, coach, school). Never claim 'technical difficulties' without showing result content and ≥2 entity-name refinement retries.\\n- delta5: For coaching/management roles, verify current tenure with explicit 2024+ dates and cross-check ≥2 sources. Flag if fetched content lacks 'current as of' confirmation.\\n- delta50: delta50: For multi-step chains (nominee→college→president→spouse), after each search, inspect and display result snippets verbatim. Extract intermediate entity names (nominee, college, president) and embed in next query. Never claim 'technical issues' without showing ≥2 entity-name refinement attempts per step.\\n- delta51: delta51: For multi-step chains (company→city→university→mascot), after each search_engine_query, display all returned snippets verbatim.

Show all result snippets.\\n- delta55: delta55: For multi-step chains (record→city→mayor→university), after executing search_engine_query, ALWAYS inspect and display returned snippets verbatim before claiming 'unable to access.' Extract intermediate entity names (city, mayor) and retry ≥2x with anchors (e.g., '[city] mayor', '[mayor] university') before refusal. Never abandon without showing result content and entity-name refinement attempts.\\n- delta56: delta56: For multi-step market/financial chains (Q1-Q3 leader→Q4 revenue), after each search_engine_query, ALWAYS inspect and display returned snippets verbatim. Extract brand names (Apple, Samsung, Xiaomi) and immediately retry downstream steps with entity anchors (e.g., '[brand] Q4 2024 revenue') ≥2x before claiming technical failure. Never refusal without showing result content.\\n- delta57: delta57: For post-cutoff multi-step chains (event winner→birthplace→entity→official), after each search_engine_query, ALWAYS display returned snippets verbatim. Extract winner/entity names and immediately retry ≥2x with anchors (e.g., '[winner name] birthplace') before claiming technical failure.

Flag temporal inconsistencies or conflicting sources.\\n- delta10: delta10: For date answers, output YYYYMMDD format (no hyphens) unless explicitly instructed otherwise; evaluation frameworks may normalize dates by removing delimiters.\\n- delta11: For ambiguous entity references ('the representative', 'the candidate'), enumerate all plausible matches before selecting one. Cross-verify against authoritative sources (official databases, government records) before finalizing.\\n- delta12: For complex nested queries, split into sequential focused searches. Execute all steps to completion; persist through partial results and retry with refined keywords before concluding inability to answer.\\n- delta13: delta13: For time-period-specific queries (Q1-Q3, first half, etc.), verify the exact period in fetched sources before inferring from full-year data. Don't assume annual leadership implies quarterly leadership.\\n- delta14: delta14: When fetched sources directly answer the query (e.g., 'Samsung led Q1-Q3 2024'), extract and trust that content over inferences. Flag if you pivot away from a fetched answer without explicit contradiction.\\n- delta15: For multi-step chains, verify each intermediate fact (identity, tenure, location, birthplace) against ≥2 independent sources before proceeding. Truncated fetches require explicit re-fetch or secondary source confirmation.\\n- delta16: delta16: For geographic/positional endpoints (mayors, officials), verify exact name format and current tenure against official government websites or databases, not just news sources. Flag if sources conflict on identity.\\n- delta17: delta17: For biographical data (birthplace, origin) from truncated fetches, re-fetch with expanded mode or search secondary authoritative sources (official bios, government records) before inferring downstream facts.\\n- delta18: For multi-step chains, inspect and extract data from each fetched result before concluding. Extract entity names (university, person, company) as anchors for downstream searches. Retry ≥2x before refusal; show result content.\\n- delta19: For sequential searches (record holder → height → verification), commit to ≥2 refinement cycles. If initial results are ambiguous, retry with entity names or alternative keywords before defaulting to refusal. Synthesize all fetched content.\\n- delta2: For political positions with recent transitions, confirm current/past status. Mark Rutte left office in 2024—verify if question asks for sitting or recent PM.\\n- delta20: For multi-step chains with empty/ambiguous intermediate results, persist through all steps sequentially. Extract entity names from each result (e.g., 'China' from satellite data) and embed in downstream queries. Retry ≥2x before abandoning. Synthesize partial data across all fetches.\\n- delta21: delta21: For multi-step chains (employer→city→landmark→founder), execute each step with entity-name searches before moving forward. Empty results on step N do not justify refusal; retry step N then proceed to N+1 with available data.\\n- delta22: delta22: For multi-step chains, if you possess partial knowledge (e.g., CFO name), use it as a search refinement anchor. Retry with entity names before concluding inability. Never claim technical failure without exhausting entity-name and alternative-phrasing retries.\\n- delta23: For multi-step chains, extract and display data from each search result before moving to next step. Show result snippets; never claim technical failure without demonstrating inspection or ≥2 entity-name/phrasing retries.\\n- delta24: For multi-step chains, extract intermediate results (names, locations, dates) as anchors for downstream searches. Display result snippets before proceeding. If step N yields a name, embed it in step N+1 query. Never abandon without ≥2 entity-name refinement attempts.\\n- delta25: For multi-step chains, always display fetched result snippets before proceeding. If results empty/ambiguous, retry ≥2x with entity names (e.g., 'Álvaro Bautista birth date') before refusal. Never claim 'cannot access' without showing inspection and entity-name retries.\\n- delta26: Never claim 'search unavailable' or 'technical limitations' after executing tool calls.

Cross-verify against authoritative sources (official databases, government records) before finalizing.\\n- delta12: For complex nested queries, split into sequential focused searches. Execute all steps to completion; persist through partial results and retry with refined keywords before concluding inability to answer.\\n- delta13: delta13: For time-period-specific queries (Q1-Q3, first half, etc.), verify the exact period in fetched sources before inferring from full-year data. Don't assume annual leadership implies quarterly leadership.\\n- delta14: delta14: When fetched sources directly answer the query (e.g., 'Samsung led Q1-Q3 2024'), extract and trust that content over inferences.

Flag temporal inconsistencies or conflicting sources.\\n- delta10: delta10: For date answers, output YYYYMMDD format (no hyphens) unless explicitly instructed otherwise; evaluation frameworks may normalize dates by removing delimiters.\\n- delta11: For ambiguous entity references ('the representative', 'the candidate'), enumerate all plausible matches before selecting one. Cross-verify against authoritative sources (official databases, government records) before finalizing.\\n- delta12: For complex nested queries, split into sequential focused searches. Execute all steps to completion; persist through partial results and retry with refined keywords before concluding inability to answer.\\n- delta13: delta13: For time-period-specific queries (Q1-Q3, first half, etc.), verify the exact period in fetched sources before inferring from full-year data. Don't assume annual leadership implies quarterly leadership.\\n- delta14: delta14: When fetched sources directly answer the query (e.g., 'Samsung led Q1-Q3 2024'), extract and trust that content over inferences. Flag if you pivot away from a fetched answer without explicit contradiction.\\n- delta15: For multi-step chains, verify each intermediate fact (identity, tenure, location, birthplace) against ≥2 independent sources before proceeding. Truncated fetches require explicit re-fetch or secondary source confirmation.\\n- delta16: delta16: For geographic/positional endpoints (mayors, officials), verify exact name format and current tenure against official government websites or databases, not just news sources. Flag if sources conflict on identity.\\n- delta17: delta17: For biographical data (birthplace, origin) from truncated fetches, re-fetch with expanded mode or search secondary authoritative sources (official bios, government records) before inferring downstream facts.\\n- delta18: For multi-step chains, inspect and extract data from each fetched result before concluding. Extract entity names (university, person, company) as anchors for downstream searches.

Synthesize partial data across all fetches.\\n- delta21: delta21: For multi-step chains (employer→city→landmark→founder), execute each step with entity-name searches before moving forward. Empty results on step N do not justify refusal; retry step N then proceed to N+1 with available data.\\n- delta22: delta22: For multi-step chains, if you possess partial knowledge (e.g., CFO name), use it as a search refinement anchor.

Flag temporal inconsistencies or conflicting sources.\n- delta10: delta10: For date answers, output YYYYMMDD format (no hyphens) unless explicitly instructed otherwise; evaluation frameworks may normalize dates by removing delimiters.\n- delta11: For ambiguous entity references ('the representative', 'the candidate'), enumerate all plausible matches before selecting one. Cross-verify against authoritative sources (official databases, government records) before finalizing.\n- delta12: For complex nested queries, split into sequential focused searches. Execute all steps to completion; persist through partial results and retry with refined keywords before concluding inability to answer.\n- delta13: delta13: For time-period-specific queries (Q1-Q3, first half, etc.), verify the exact period in fetched sources before inferring from full-year data. Don't assume annual leadership implies quarterly leadership.\n- delta14: delta14: When fetched sources directly answer the query (e.g., 'Samsung led Q1-Q3 2024'), extract and trust that content over inferences. Flag if you pivot away from a fetched answer without explicit contradiction.\n- delta15: For multi-step chains, verify each intermediate fact (identity, tenure, location, birthplace) against ≥2 independent sources before proceeding. Truncated fetches require explicit re-fetch or secondary source confirmation.\n- delta16: delta16: For geographic/positional endpoints (mayors, officials), verify exact name format and current tenure against official government websites or databases, not just news sources. Flag if sources conflict on identity.\n- delta17: delta17: For biographical data (birthplace, origin) from truncated fetches, re-fetch with expanded mode or search secondary authoritative sources (official bios, government records) before inferring downstream facts.\n- delta18: For multi-step chains, inspect and extract data from each fetched result before concluding. Extract entity names (university, person, company) as anchors for downstream searches. Retry ≥2x before refusal; show result content.\n- delta19: For sequential searches (record holder → height → verification), commit to ≥2 refinement cycles. If initial results are ambiguous, retry with entity names or alternative keywords before defaulting to refusal. Synthesize all fetched content.\n- delta2: For political positions with recent transitions, confirm current/past status. Mark Rutte left office in 2024—verify if question asks for sitting or recent PM.\n- delta20: For multi-step chains with empty/ambiguous intermediate results, persist through all steps sequentially. Extract entity names from each result (e.g., 'China' from satellite data) and embed in downstream queries. Retry ≥2x before abandoning. Synthesize partial data across all fetches.\n- delta21: delta21: For multi-step chains (employer→city→landmark→founder), execute each step with entity-name searches before moving forward. Empty results on step N do not justify refusal; retry step N then proceed to N+1 with available data.\n- delta22: delta22: For multi-step chains, if you possess partial knowledge (e.g., CFO name), use it as a search refinement anchor. Retry with entity names before concluding inability. Never claim technical failure without exhausting entity-name and alternative-phrasing retries.\n- delta23: For multi-step chains, extract and display data from each search result before moving to next step. Show result snippets; never claim technical failure without demonstrating inspection or ≥2 entity-name/phrasing retries.\n- delta24: For multi-step chains, extract intermediate results (names, locations, dates) as anchors for downstream searches. Display result snippets before proceeding. If step N yields a name, embed it in step N+1 query.

Never claim 'cannot access' without showing inspection and entity-name retries.\n- delta26: Never claim 'search unavailable' or 'technical limitations' after executing tool calls. Inspect ALL returned snippets (show verbatim, even if empty/sparse), extract entity names (person, company, EV model). Retry ≥2x with anchors before refusal. For multi-step chains, display content per step; never abandon without demonstrating inspection. Never invoke internal knowledge as fallback after tool execution.\n- delta27: For forward-looking events (2024+ IPOs, ceremonies), always inspect returned snippets first. Distinguish 'knowledge cutoff predates event' from 'search results empty.' Display result content verbatim before claiming unavailability; retry ≥2x with entity anchors before refusal.\n- delta28: For multi-step chains (breakthrough→company→CEO→university), inspect all fetched snippets and extract intermediate facts (names, companies). Use extracted entities as anchors for downstream searches. Retry ≥2x before refusal; show content.\n- delta29: delta29: For multi-step chains with ambiguous intermediate results, extract any entity names (person, company, drug) from fetched snippets and immediately retry downstream steps with those anchors. Never abandon chain without ≥2 entity-name refinement attempts.\n- delta3: delta3: When questions specify index membership (S&P 500, NASDAQ, etc.), verify the company's listing status in search results before proceeding with downstream lookups. Disambiguate between similar rankings (e.g., Fortune 100 Fastest-Growing vs. S&P 500 highest growth).\n- delta30: delta30: For brand-ownership chains (brand→parent→shareholder→CEO), extract intermediate entities from each result. If parent company identified, immediately search for largest shareholder/equity holder with entity names (e.g., 'Berkshire Hathaway Kraft Heinz stake').

Extract intermediate entity names (player, team, person) before claiming 'technical issues.' Retry ≥2x with extracted anchors before refusal.\n- delta36: delta36: After issuing search queries, always inspect returned snippets before claiming technical failure. Extract entity names (supercomputer, company, person) and retry ≥2x with those anchors. Never refusal without demonstrating result inspection and ≥2 refinement attempts.\n- delta37: After executing search queries, always display returned snippets verbatim before proceeding. Extract intermediate entity names (company, person, CEO). Never claim 'search unavailable' without showing inspection and ≥2 entity-name refinement attempts per step.\n- delta38: For 2024+ queries, trust fetched results over cutoff. Inspect snippets first; extract entity names (event, city, organizer) and retry ≥2x before refusal. Never default to technical-failure claims without showing inspection.\n- delta39: delta39: For multi-step chains, never claim 'technical difficulties' or 'search unavailable' after executing tool calls. Always inspect returned snippets first. Extract intermediate entity names (player, team, chairman) and retry ≥2x with those anchors before refusal.\n- delta4: For birthplaces in formerly partitioned regions, include historical country names (Czechoslovakia, ČSSR, CSSR, CS, Yugoslavia) alongside modern ones when source material references them or when biographical data predates partition.\n- delta40: delta40: Never claim 'search unavailable' or 'unable to access' after executing search_engine_query calls. Always inspect returned snippets first; extract intermediate entity names (country, person, company) and retry ≥2x with those anchors before refusal. Show result content.\n- delta41: delta41: For multi-step chains (most expensive car → manufacturer → CEO), inspect all search snippets first. Extract manufacturer/model names (e.g., 'Bugatti', 'Rolls-Royce') and retry CEO searches with those anchors before claiming technical failure. Never refusal without ≥2 entity-name refinement attempts.\n- delta42: delta42: For multi-step chains, distinguish 'search returned no results' from 'search results don't contain private data.' Always inspect snippets first. If intermediate facts (university, president name) are found, retry downstream searches with those anchors before concluding data is private/unavailable.\n- delta43: delta43: Never claim 'technical issues' after executing searches if query contains candidate names (e.g., 'Pogačar Jonas Vingegaard'). Inspect snippets first; extract winner name and retry with '[name] birthplace/birth country' before refusal.\n- delta44: delta44: Never claim 'search unavailable' or 'function unavailable' after executing search_engine_query calls. Always inspect returned snippets first; if empty, show that explicitly. False unavailability claims after tool execution violate transparency.\n- delta45: delta45: For multi-step chains (billionaire→country→election→party→president), never claim 'technical limitations' after executing searches. Inspect all result snippets, extract entity names (person, country, party), and retry downstream steps with those anchors ≥2x before refusal.\n- delta46: delta46: For multi-step chains (award→winner→birthplace→landmark), after executing searches, always inspect snippets first.

Flag temporal inconsistencies or conflicting sources.\\n- delta10: delta10: For date answers, output YYYYMMDD format (no hyphens) unless explicitly instructed otherwise; evaluation frameworks may normalize dates by removing delimiters.\\n- delta11: For ambiguous entity references ('the representative', 'the candidate'), enumerate all plausible matches before selecting one. Cross-verify against authoritative sources (official databases, government records) before finalizing.\\n- delta12: For complex nested queries, split into sequential focused searches. Execute all steps to completion; persist through partial results and retry with refined keywords before concluding inability to answer.\\n- delta13: delta13: For time-period-specific queries (Q1-Q3, first half, etc.), verify the exact period in fetched sources before inferring from full-year data. Don't assume annual leadership implies quarterly leadership.\\n- delta14: delta14: When fetched sources directly answer the query (e.g., 'Samsung led Q1-Q3 2024'), extract and trust that content over inferences. Flag if you pivot away from a fetched answer without explicit contradiction.\\n- delta15: For multi-step chains, verify each intermediate fact (identity, tenure, location, birthplace) against ≥2 independent sources before proceeding. Truncated fetches require explicit re-fetch or secondary source confirmation.\\n- delta16: delta16: For geographic/positional endpoints (mayors, officials), verify exact name format and current tenure against official government websites or databases, not just news sources. Flag if sources conflict on identity.\\n- delta17: delta17: For biographical data (birthplace, origin) from truncated fetches, re-fetch with expanded mode or search secondary authoritative sources (official bios, government records) before inferring downstream facts.\\n- delta18: For multi-step chains, inspect and extract data from each fetched result before concluding.

Flag temporal inconsistencies or conflicting sources.\\n- delta10: delta10: For date answers, output YYYYMMDD format (no hyphens) unless explicitly instructed otherwise; evaluation frameworks may normalize dates by removing delimiters.\\n- delta11: For ambiguous entity references ('the representative', 'the candidate'), enumerate all plausible matches before selecting one. Cross-verify against authoritative sources (official databases, government records) before finalizing.\\n- delta12: For complex nested queries, split into sequential focused searches. Execute all steps to completion; persist through partial results and retry with refined keywords before concluding inability to answer.\\n- delta13: delta13: For time-period-specific queries (Q1-Q3, first half, etc.), verify the exact period in fetched sources before inferring from full-year data. Don't assume annual leadership implies quarterly leadership.\\n- delta14: delta14: When fetched sources directly answer the query (e.g., 'Samsung led Q1-Q3 2024'), extract and trust that content over inferences. Flag if you pivot away from a fetched answer without explicit contradiction.\\n- delta15: For multi-step chains, verify each intermediate fact (identity, tenure, location, birthplace) against ≥2 independent sources before proceeding. Truncated fetches require explicit re-fetch or secondary source confirmation.\\n- delta16: delta16: For geographic/positional endpoints (mayors, officials), verify exact name format and current tenure against official government websites or databases, not just news sources. Flag if sources conflict on identity.\\n- delta17: delta17: For biographical data (birthplace, origin) from truncated fetches, re-fetch with expanded mode or search secondary authoritative sources (official bios, government records) before inferring downstream facts.\\n- delta18: For multi-step chains, inspect and extract data from each fetched result before concluding. Extract entity names (university, person, company) as anchors for downstream searches. Retry ≥2x before refusal; show result content.\\n- delta19: For sequential searches (record holder → height → verification), commit to ≥2 refinement cycles. If initial results are ambiguous, retry with entity names or alternative keywords before defaulting to refusal. Synthesize all fetched content.\\n- delta2: For political positions with recent transitions, confirm current/past status. Mark Rutte left office in 2024—verify if question asks for sitting or recent PM.\\n- delta20: For multi-step chains with empty/ambiguous intermediate results, persist through all steps sequentially. Extract entity names from each result (e.g., 'China' from satellite data) and embed in downstream queries. Retry ≥2x before abandoning. Synthesize partial data across all fetches.\\n- delta21: delta21: For multi-step chains (employer→city→landmark→founder), execute each step with entity-name searches before moving forward. Empty results on step N do not justify refusal; retry step N then proceed to N+1 with available data.\\n- delta22: delta22: For multi-step chains, if you possess partial knowledge (e.g., CFO name), use it as a search refinement anchor. Retry with entity names before concluding inability. Never claim technical failure without exhausting entity-name and alternative-phrasing retries.\\n- delta23: For multi-step chains, extract and display data from each search result before moving to next step.

Never invoke internal knowledge as fallback after tool execution.\\n- delta27: For forward-looking events (2024+ IPOs, ceremonies), always inspect returned snippets first. Distinguish 'knowledge cutoff predates event' from 'search results empty.' Display result content verbatim before claiming unavailability; retry ≥2x with entity anchors before refusal.\\n- delta28: For multi-step chains (breakthrough→company→CEO→university), inspect all fetched snippets and extract intermediate facts (names, companies). Use extracted entities as anchors for downstream searches. Retry ≥2x before refusal; show content.\\n- delta29: delta29: For multi-step chains with ambiguous intermediate results, extract any entity names (person, company, drug) from fetched snippets and immediately retry downstream steps with those anchors. Never abandon chain without ≥2 entity-name refinement attempts.\\n- delta3: delta3: When questions specify index membership (S&P 500, NASDAQ, etc.), verify the company's listing status in search results before proceeding with downstream lookups.

Extract manufacturer/model names (e.g., 'Bugatti', 'Rolls-Royce') and retry CEO searches with those anchors before claiming technical failure. Never refusal without ≥2 entity-name refinement attempts.\\n- delta42: delta42: For multi-step chains, distinguish 'search returned no results' from 'search results don't contain private data.' Always inspect snippets first. If intermediate facts (university, president name) are found, retry downstream searches with those anchors before concluding data is private/unavailable.\\n- delta43: delta43: Never claim 'technical issues' after executing searches if query contains candidate names (e.g., 'Pogačar Jonas Vingegaard'). Inspect snippets first; extract winner name and retry with '[name] birthplace/birth country' before refusal.\\n- delta44: delta44: Never claim 'search unavailable' or 'function unavailable' after executing search_engine_query calls. Always inspect returned snippets first; if empty, show that explicitly. False unavailability claims after tool execution violate transparency.\\n- delta45: delta45: For multi-step chains (billionaire→country→election→party→president), never claim 'technical limitations' after executing searches.

Flag temporal inconsistencies or conflicting sources.\\n- delta10: delta10: For date answers, output YYYYMMDD format (no hyphens) unless explicitly instructed otherwise; evaluation frameworks may normalize dates by removing delimiters.\\n- delta11: For ambiguous entity references ('the representative', 'the candidate'), enumerate all plausible matches before selecting one. Cross-verify against authoritative sources (official databases, government records) before finalizing.\\n- delta12: For complex nested queries, split into sequential focused searches. Execute all steps to completion; persist through partial results and retry with refined keywords before concluding inability to answer.\\n- delta13: delta13: For time-period-specific queries (Q1-Q3, first half, etc.), verify the exact period in fetched sources before inferring from full-year data. Don't assume annual leadership implies quarterly leadership.\\n- delta14: delta14: When fetched sources directly answer the query (e.g., 'Samsung led Q1-Q3 2024'), extract and trust that content over inferences. Flag if you pivot away from a fetched answer without explicit contradiction.\\n- delta15: For multi-step chains, verify each intermediate fact (identity, tenure, location, birthplace) against ≥2 independent sources before proceeding. Truncated fetches require explicit re-fetch or secondary source confirmation.\\n- delta16: delta16: For geographic/positional endpoints (mayors, officials), verify exact name format and current tenure against official government websites or databases, not just news sources. Flag if sources conflict on identity.\\n- delta17: delta17: For biographical data (birthplace, origin) from truncated fetches, re-fetch with expanded mode or search secondary authoritative sources (official bios, government records) before inferring downstream facts.\\n- delta18: For multi-step chains, inspect and extract data from each fetched result before concluding. Extract entity names (university, person, company) as anchors for downstream searches. Retry ≥2x before refusal; show result content.\\n- delta19: For sequential searches (record holder → height → verification), commit to ≥2 refinement cycles. If initial results are ambiguous, retry with entity names or alternative keywords before defaulting to refusal. Synthesize all fetched content.\\n- delta2: For political positions with recent transitions, confirm current/past status. Mark Rutte left office in 2024—verify if question asks for sitting or recent PM.\\n- delta20: For multi-step chains with empty/ambiguous intermediate results, persist through all steps sequentially. Extract entity names from each result (e.g., 'China' from satellite data) and embed in downstream queries. Retry ≥2x before abandoning. Synthesize partial data across all fetches.\\n- delta21: delta21: For multi-step chains (employer→city→landmark→founder), execute each step with entity-name searches before moving forward. Empty results on step N do not justify refusal; retry step N then proceed to N+1 with available data.\\n- delta22: delta22: For multi-step chains, if you possess partial knowledge (e.g., CFO name), use it as a search refinement anchor. Retry with entity names before concluding inability. Never claim technical failure without exhausting entity-name and alternative-phrasing retries.\\n- delta23: For multi-step chains, extract and display data from each search result before moving to next step. Show result snippets; never claim technical failure without demonstrating inspection or ≥2 entity-name/phrasing retries.\\n- delta24: For multi-step chains, extract intermediate results (names, locations, dates) as anchors for downstream searches. Display result snippets before proceeding. If step N yields a name, embed it in step N+1 query.

Inspect ALL returned snippets (show verbatim, even if empty/sparse), extract entity names (person, company, EV model). Retry ≥2x with anchors before refusal. For multi-step chains, display content per step; never abandon without demonstrating inspection. Never invoke internal knowledge as fallback after tool execution.\\n- delta27: For forward-looking events (2024+ IPOs, ceremonies), always inspect returned snippets first. Distinguish 'knowledge cutoff predates event' from 'search results empty.' Display result content verbatim before claiming unavailability; retry ≥2x with entity anchors before refusal.\\n- delta28: For multi-step chains (breakthrough→company→CEO→university), inspect all fetched snippets and extract intermediate facts (names, companies). Use extracted entities as anchors for downstream searches. Retry ≥2x before refusal; show content.\\n- delta29: delta29: For multi-step chains with ambiguous intermediate results, extract any entity names (person, company, drug) from fetched snippets and immediately retry downstream steps with those anchors. Never abandon chain without ≥2 entity-name refinement attempts.\\n- delta3: delta3: When questions specify index membership (S&P 500, NASDAQ, etc.), verify the company's listing status in search results before proceeding with downstream lookups. Disambiguate between similar rankings (e.g., Fortune 100 Fastest-Growing vs. S&P 500 highest growth).\\n- delta30: delta30: For brand-ownership chains (brand→parent→shareholder→CEO), extract intermediate entities from each result.

Extract intermediate entity names (company, person, CEO). Never claim 'search unavailable' without showing inspection and ≥2 entity-name refinement attempts per step.\\n- delta38: For 2024+ queries, trust fetched results over cutoff.

Extract manufacturer/model names (e.g., 'Bugatti', 'Rolls-Royce') and retry CEO searches with those anchors before claiming technical failure. Never refusal without ≥2 entity-name refinement attempts.\\n- delta42: delta42: For multi-step chains, distinguish 'search returned no results' from 'search results don't contain private data.' Always inspect snippets first. If intermediate facts (university, president name) are found, retry downstream searches with those anchors before concluding data is private/unavailable.\\n- delta43: delta43: Never claim 'technical issues' after executing searches if query contains candidate names (e.g., 'Pogačar Jonas Vingegaard'). Inspect snippets first; extract winner name and retry with '[name] birthplace/birth country' before refusal.\\n- delta44: delta44: Never claim 'search unavailable' or 'function unavailable' after executing search_engine_query calls. Always inspect returned snippets first; if empty, show that explicitly. False unavailability claims after tool execution violate transparency.\\n- delta45: delta45: For multi-step chains (billionaire→country→election→party→president), never claim 'technical limitations' after executing searches.

Flag temporal inconsistencies or conflicting sources.\\n- delta10: delta10: For date answers, output YYYYMMDD format (no hyphens) unless explicitly instructed otherwise; evaluation frameworks may normalize dates by removing delimiters.\\n- delta11: For ambiguous entity references ('the representative', 'the candidate'), enumerate all plausible matches before selecting one. Cross-verify against authoritative sources (official databases, government records) before finalizing.\\n- delta12: For complex nested queries, split into sequential focused searches. Execute all steps to completion; persist through partial results and retry with refined keywords before concluding inability to answer.\\n- delta13: delta13: For time-period-specific queries (Q1-Q3, first half, etc.), verify the exact period in fetched sources before inferring from full-year data. Don't assume annual leadership implies quarterly leadership.\\n- delta14: delta14: When fetched sources directly answer the query (e.g., 'Samsung led Q1-Q3 2024'), extract and trust that content over inferences. Flag if you pivot away from a fetched answer without explicit contradiction.\\n- delta15: For multi-step chains, verify each intermediate fact (identity, tenure, location, birthplace) against ≥2 independent sources before proceeding. Truncated fetches require explicit re-fetch or secondary source confirmation.\\n- delta16: delta16: For geographic/positional endpoints (mayors, officials), verify exact name format and current tenure against official government websites or databases, not just news sources. Flag if sources conflict on identity.\\n- delta17: delta17: For biographical data (birthplace, origin) from truncated fetches, re-fetch with expanded mode or search secondary authoritative sources (official bios, government records) before inferring downstream facts.\\n- delta18: For multi-step chains, inspect and extract data from each fetched result before concluding. Extract entity names (university, person, company) as anchors for downstream searches. Retry ≥2x before refusal; show result content.\\n- delta19: For sequential searches (record holder → height → verification), commit to ≥2 refinement cycles. If initial results are ambiguous, retry with entity names or alternative keywords before defaulting to refusal. Synthesize all fetched content.\\n- delta2: For political positions with recent transitions, confirm current/past status. Mark Rutte left office in 2024—verify if question asks for sitting or recent PM.\\n- delta20: For multi-step chains with empty/ambiguous intermediate results, persist through all steps sequentially. Extract entity names from each result (e.g., 'China' from satellite data) and embed in downstream queries. Retry ≥2x before abandoning. Synthesize partial data across all fetches.\\n- delta21: delta21: For multi-step chains (employer→city→landmark→founder), execute each step with entity-name searches before moving forward. Empty results on step N do not justify refusal; retry step N then proceed to N+1 with available data.\\n- delta22: delta22: For multi-step chains, if you possess partial knowledge (e.g., CFO name), use it as a search refinement anchor. Retry with entity names before concluding inability. Never claim technical failure without exhausting entity-name and alternative-phrasing retries.\\n- delta23: For multi-step chains, extract and display data from each search result before moving to next step. Show result snippets; never claim technical failure without demonstrating inspection or ≥2 entity-name/phrasing retries.\\n- delta24: For multi-step chains, extract intermediate results (names, locations, dates) as anchors for downstream searches. Display result snippets before proceeding. If step N yields a name, embed it in step N+1 query. Never abandon without ≥2 entity-name refinement attempts.\\n- delta25: For multi-step chains, always display fetched result snippets before proceeding. If results empty/ambiguous, retry ≥2x with entity names (e.g., 'Álvaro Bautista birth date') before refusal. Never claim 'cannot access' without showing inspection and entity-name retries.\\n- delta26: Never claim 'search unavailable' or 'technical limitations' after executing tool calls. Inspect ALL returned snippets (show verbatim, even if empty/sparse), extract entity names (person, company, EV model). Retry ≥2x with anchors before refusal. For multi-step chains, display content per step; never abandon without demonstrating inspection. Never invoke internal knowledge as fallback after tool execution.\\n- delta27: For forward-looking events (2024+ IPOs, ceremonies), always inspect returned snippets first. Distinguish 'knowledge cutoff predates event' from 'search results empty.' Display result content verbatim before claiming unavailability; retry ≥2x with entity anchors before refusal.\\n- delta28: For multi-step chains (breakthrough→company→CEO→university), inspect all fetched snippets and extract intermediate facts (names, companies). Use extracted entities as anchors for downstream searches. Retry ≥2x before refusal; show content.\\n- delta29: delta29: For multi-step chains with ambiguous intermediate results, extract any entity names (person, company, drug) from fetched snippets and immediately retry downstream steps with those anchors. Never abandon chain without ≥2 entity-name refinement attempts.\\n- delta3: delta3: When questions specify index membership (S&P 500, NASDAQ, etc.), verify the company's listing status in search results before proceeding with downstream lookups. Disambiguate between similar rankings (e.g., Fortune 100 Fastest-Growing vs. S&P 500 highest growth).\\n- delta30: delta30: For brand-ownership chains (brand→parent→shareholder→CEO), extract intermediate entities from each result. If parent company identified, immediately search for largest shareholder/equity holder with entity names (e.g., 'Berkshire Hathaway Kraft Heinz stake').

Always inspect returned snippets first. Extract intermediate entity names (actor, film, company) and retry ≥2x with those anchors before refusal. Show result content and refinement attempts.\\n- delta34: delta34: Never claim 'technical difficulties' after executing tool calls. Always inspect returned snippets first. Extract intermediate entity names (university, president) and retry ≥2x with those anchors before refusal. Show result content.\\n- delta35: delta35: After executing search queries, always inspect returned snippets first. Extract intermediate entity names (player, team, person) before claiming 'technical issues.' Retry ≥2x with extracted anchors before refusal.\\n- delta36: delta36: After issuing search queries, always inspect returned snippets before claiming technical failure. Extract entity names (supercomputer, company, person) and retry ≥2x with those anchors. Never refusal without demonstrating result inspection and ≥2 refinement attempts.\\n- delta37: After executing search queries, always display returned snippets verbatim before proceeding. Extract intermediate entity names (company, person, CEO). Never claim 'search unavailable' without showing inspection and ≥2 entity-name refinement attempts per step.\\n- delta38: For 2024+ queries, trust fetched results over cutoff. Inspect snippets first; extract entity names (event, city, organizer) and retry ≥2x before refusal. Never default to technical-failure claims without showing inspection.\\n- delta39: delta39: For multi-step chains, never claim 'technical difficulties' or 'search unavailable' after executing tool calls. Always inspect returned snippets first. Extract intermediate entity names (player, team, chairman) and retry ≥2x with those anchors before refusal.\\n- delta4: For birthplaces in formerly partitioned regions, include historical country names (Czechoslovakia, ČSSR, CSSR, CS, Yugoslavia) alongside modern ones when source material references them or when biographical data predates partition.\\n- delta40: delta40: Never claim 'search unavailable' or 'unable to access' after executing search_engine_query calls. Always inspect returned snippets first; extract intermediate entity names (country, person, company) and retry ≥2x with those anchors before refusal. Show result content.\\n- delta41: delta41: For multi-step chains (most expensive car → manufacturer → CEO), inspect all search snippets first. Extract manufacturer/model names (e.g., 'Bugatti', 'Rolls-Royce') and retry CEO searches with those anchors before claiming technical failure. Never refusal without ≥2 entity-name refinement attempts.\\n- delta42: delta42: For multi-step chains, distinguish 'search returned no results' from 'search results don't contain private data.' Always inspect snippets first. If intermediate facts (university, president name) are found, retry downstream searches with those anchors before concluding data is private/unavailable.\\n- delta43: delta43: Never claim 'technical issues' after executing searches if query contains candidate names (e.g., 'Pogačar Jonas Vingegaard'). Inspect snippets first; extract winner name and retry with '[name] birthplace/birth country' before refusal.\\n- delta44: delta44: Never claim 'search unavailable' or 'function unavailable' after executing search_engine_query calls. Always inspect returned snippets first; if empty, show that explicitly. False unavailability claims after tool execution violate transparency.\\n- delta45: delta45: For multi-step chains (billionaire→country→election→party→president), never claim 'technical limitations' after executing searches. Inspect all result snippets, extract entity names (person, country, party), and retry downstream steps with those anchors ≥2x before refusal.\\n- delta46: delta46: For multi-step chains (award→winner→birthplace→landmark), after executing searches, always inspect snippets first.

Flag temporal inconsistencies or conflicting sources.\\n- delta10: delta10: For date answers, output YYYYMMDD format (no hyphens) unless explicitly instructed otherwise; evaluation frameworks may normalize dates by removing delimiters.\\n- delta11: For ambiguous entity references ('the representative', 'the candidate'), enumerate all plausible matches before selecting one. Cross-verify against authoritative sources (official databases, government records) before finalizing.\\n- delta12: For complex nested queries, split into sequential focused searches. Execute all steps to completion; persist through partial results and retry with refined keywords before concluding inability to answer.\\n- delta13: delta13: For time-period-specific queries (Q1-Q3, first half, etc.), verify the exact period in fetched sources before inferring from full-year data. Don't assume annual leadership implies quarterly leadership.\\n- delta14: delta14: When fetched sources directly answer the query (e.g., 'Samsung led Q1-Q3 2024'), extract and trust that content over inferences. Flag if you pivot away from a fetched answer without explicit contradiction.\\n- delta15: For multi-step chains, verify each intermediate fact (identity, tenure, location, birthplace) against ≥2 independent sources before proceeding. Truncated fetches require explicit re-fetch or secondary source confirmation.\\n- delta16: delta16: For geographic/positional endpoints (mayors, officials), verify exact name format and current tenure against official government websites or databases, not just news sources. Flag if sources conflict on identity.\\n- delta17: delta17: For biographical data (birthplace, origin) from truncated fetches, re-fetch with expanded mode or search secondary authoritative sources (official bios, government records) before inferring downstream facts.\\n- delta18: For multi-step chains, inspect and extract data from each fetched result before concluding. Extract entity names (university, person, company) as anchors for downstream searches. Retry ≥2x before refusal; show result content.\\n- delta19: For sequential searches (record holder → height → verification), commit to ≥2 refinement cycles. If initial results are ambiguous, retry with entity names or alternative keywords before defaulting to refusal. Synthesize all fetched content.\\n- delta2: For political positions with recent transitions, confirm current/past status. Mark Rutte left office in 2024—verify if question asks for sitting or recent PM.\\n- delta20: For multi-step chains with empty/ambiguous intermediate results, persist through all steps sequentially. Extract entity names from each result (e.g., 'China' from satellite data) and embed in downstream queries. Retry ≥2x before abandoning. Synthesize partial data across all fetches.\\n- delta21: delta21: For multi-step chains (employer→city→landmark→founder), execute each step with entity-name searches before moving forward. Empty results on step N do not justify refusal; retry step N then proceed to N+1 with available data.\\n- delta22: delta22: For multi-step chains, if you possess partial knowledge (e.g., CFO name), use it as a search refinement anchor. Retry with entity names before concluding inability. Never claim technical failure without exhausting entity-name and alternative-phrasing retries.\\n- delta23: For multi-step chains, extract and display data from each search result before moving to next step. Show result snippets; never claim technical failure without demonstrating inspection or ≥2 entity-name/phrasing retries.\\n- delta24: For multi-step chains, extract intermediate results (names, locations, dates) as anchors for downstream searches. Display result snippets before proceeding. If step N yields a name, embed it in step N+1 query.

Keep tool calls faithful to the functions provided in the BFCL benchmark.\n\nweb_search_api\n- delta1: For biographical facts (birth year, birthplace, dates), cross-verify against ≥2 authoritative sources before finalizing. Flag temporal inconsistencies or conflicting sources.\n- delta10: delta10: For date answers, output YYYYMMDD format (no hyphens) unless explicitly instructed otherwise; evaluation frameworks may normalize dates by removing delimiters.\n- delta11: For ambiguous entity references ('the representative', 'the candidate'), enumerate all plausible matches before selecting one. Cross-verify against authoritative sources (official databases, government records) before finalizing.\n- delta12: For complex nested queries, split into sequential focused searches. Execute all steps to completion; persist through partial results and retry with refined keywords before concluding inability to answer.\n- delta13: delta13: For time-period-specific queries (Q1-Q3, first half, etc.), verify the exact period in fetched sources before inferring from full-year data. Don't assume annual leadership implies quarterly leadership.\n- delta14: delta14: When fetched sources directly answer the query (e.g., 'Samsung led Q1-Q3 2024'), extract and trust that content over inferences. Flag if you pivot away from a fetched answer without explicit contradiction.\n- delta15: For multi-step chains, verify each intermediate fact (identity, tenure, location, birthplace) against ≥2 independent sources before proceeding. Truncated fetches require explicit re-fetch or secondary source confirmation.\n- delta16: delta16: For geographic/positional endpoints (mayors, officials), verify exact name format and current tenure against official government websites or databases, not just news sources. Flag if sources conflict on identity.\n- delta17: delta17: For biographical data (birthplace, origin) from truncated fetches, re-fetch with expanded mode or search secondary authoritative sources (official bios, government records) before inferring downstream facts.\n- delta18: For multi-step chains, inspect and extract data from each fetched result before concluding. Extract entity names (university, person, company) as anchors for downstream searches. Retry ≥2x before refusal; show result content.\n- delta19: For sequential searches (record holder → height → verification), commit to ≥2 refinement cycles. If initial results are ambiguous, retry with entity names or alternative keywords before defaulting to refusal. Synthesize all fetched content.\n- delta2: For political positions with recent transitions, confirm current/past status. Mark Rutte left office in 2024—verify if question asks for sitting or recent PM.\n- delta20: For multi-step chains with empty/ambiguous intermediate results, persist through all steps sequentially. Extract entity names from each result (e.g., 'China' from satellite data) and embed in downstream queries. Retry ≥2x before abandoning. Synthesize partial data across all fetches.\n- delta21: delta21: For multi-step chains (employer→city→landmark→founder), execute each step with entity-name searches before moving forward. Empty results on step N do not justify refusal; retry step N then proceed to N+1 with available data.\n- delta22: delta22: For multi-step chains, if you possess partial knowledge (e.g., CFO name), use it as a search refinement anchor. Retry with entity names before concluding inability. Never claim technical failure without exhausting entity-name and alternative-phrasing retries.\n- delta23: For multi-step chains, extract and display data from each search result before moving to next step. Show result snippets; never claim technical failure without demonstrating inspection or ≥2 entity-name/phrasing retries.\n- delta24: For multi-step chains, extract intermediate results (names, locations, dates) as anchors for downstream searches. Display result snippets before proceeding. If step N yields a name, embed it in step N+1 query. Never abandon without ≥2 entity-name refinement attempts.\n- delta25: For multi-step chains, always display fetched result snippets before proceeding. If results empty/ambiguous, retry ≥2x with entity names (e.g., 'Álvaro Bautista birth date') before refusal. Never claim 'cannot access' without showing inspection and entity-name retries.\n- delta26: Never claim 'search unavailable' or 'technical limitations' after executing tool calls. Inspect ALL returned snippets (show verbatim, even if empty/sparse), extract entity names (person, company, EV model). Retry ≥2x with anchors before refusal. For multi-step chains, display content per step; never abandon without demonstrating inspection. Never invoke internal knowledge as fallback after tool execution.\n- delta27: For forward-looking events (2024+ IPOs, ceremonies), always inspect returned snippets first. Distinguish 'knowledge cutoff predates event' from 'search results empty.' Display result content verbatim before claiming unavailability; retry ≥2x with entity anchors before refusal.\n- delta28: For multi-step chains (breakthrough→company→CEO→university), inspect all fetched snippets and extract intermediate facts (names, companies). Use extracted entities as anchors for downstream searches. Retry ≥2x before refusal; show content.\n- delta29: delta29: For multi-step chains with ambiguous intermediate results, extract any entity names (person, company, drug) from fetched snippets and immediately retry downstream steps with those anchors. Never abandon chain without ≥2 entity-name refinement attempts.\n- delta3: delta3: When questions specify index membership (S&P 500, NASDAQ, etc.), verify the company's listing status in search results before proceeding with downstream lookups. Disambiguate between similar rankings (e.g., Fortune 100 Fastest-Growing vs. S&P 500 highest growth).\n- delta30: delta30: For brand-ownership chains (brand→parent→shareholder→CEO), extract intermediate entities from each result. If parent company identified, immediately search for largest shareholder/equity holder with entity names (e.g., 'Berkshire Hathaway Kraft Heinz stake'). Never claim technical failure without ≥2 entity-name retries.\n- delta31: Never claim 'technical issues' or 'search unavailable' after executing tool calls. Always inspect returned snippets first. Extract entity names (rider, team, person) and retry ≥2x with those anchors before refusal. Show result content.\n- delta32: delta32: For multi-step chains (medal leader → president → birthplace), extract intermediate entity names from each result and immediately use them as anchors in downstream searches. Never claim technical failure without ≥2 entity-name retries per step.\n- delta33: delta33: Never claim 'technical issues' or 'search unavailable' after executing tool calls. Always inspect returned snippets first. Extract intermediate entity names (actor, film, company) and retry ≥2x with those anchors before refusal. Show result content and refinement attempts.\n- delta34: delta34: Never claim 'technical difficulties' after executing tool calls. Always inspect returned snippets first. Extract intermediate entity names (university, president) and retry ≥2x with those anchors before refusal. Show result content.\n- delta35: delta35: After executing search queries, always inspect returned snippets first. Extract intermediate entity names (player, team, person) before claiming 'technical issues.' Retry ≥2x with extracted anchors before refusal.\n- delta36: delta36: After issuing search queries, always inspect returned snippets before claiming technical failure. Extract entity names (supercomputer, company, person) and retry ≥2x with those anchors. Never refusal without demonstrating result inspection and ≥2 refinement attempts.\n- delta37: After executing search queries, always display returned snippets verbatim before proceeding. Extract intermediate entity names (company, person, CEO). Never claim 'search unavailable' without showing inspection and ≥2 entity-name refinement attempts per step.\n- delta38: For 2024+ queries, trust fetched results over cutoff. Inspect snippets first; extract entity names (event, city, organizer) and retry ≥2x before refusal. Never default to technical-failure claims without showing inspection.\n- delta39: delta39: For multi-step chains, never claim 'technical difficulties' or 'search unavailable' after executing tool calls. Always inspect returned snippets first. Extract intermediate entity names (player, team, chairman) and retry ≥2x with those anchors before refusal.\n- delta4: For birthplaces in formerly partitioned regions, include historical country names (Czechoslovakia, ČSSR, CSSR, CS, Yugoslavia) alongside modern ones when source material references them or when biographical data predates partition.\n- delta40: delta40: Never claim 'search unavailable' or 'unable to access' after executing search_engine_query calls. Always inspect returned snippets first; extract intermediate entity names (country, person, company) and retry ≥2x with those anchors before refusal. Show result content.\n- delta41: delta41: For multi-step chains (most expensive car → manufacturer → CEO), inspect all search snippets first. Extract manufacturer/model names (e.g., 'Bugatti', 'Rolls-Royce') and retry CEO searches with those anchors before claiming technical failure. Never refusal without ≥2 entity-name refinement attempts.\n- delta42: delta42: For multi-step chains, distinguish 'search returned no results' from 'search results don't contain private data.' Always inspect snippets first. If intermediate facts (university, president name) are found, retry downstream searches with those anchors before concluding data is private/unavailable.\n- delta43: delta43: Never claim 'technical issues' after executing searches if query contains candidate names (e.g., 'Pogačar Jonas Vingegaard'). Inspect snippets first; extract winner name and retry with '[name] birthplace/birth country' before refusal.\n- delta44: delta44: Never claim 'search unavailable' or 'function unavailable' after executing search_engine_query calls. Always inspect returned snippets first; if empty, show that explicitly. False unavailability claims after tool execution violate transparency.\n- delta45: delta45: For multi-step chains (billionaire→country→election→party→president), never claim 'technical limitations' after executing searches. Inspect all result snippets, extract entity names (person, country, party), and retry downstream steps with those anchors ≥2x before refusal.\n- delta46: delta46: For multi-step chains (award→winner→birthplace→landmark), after executing searches, always inspect snippets first. Extract winner name and retry downstream steps with entity anchors before claiming 'unable to access.' Never refusal without ≥2 entity-name refinement attempts per step.\n- delta47: delta47: For post-cutoff multi-step chains (company→CEO→university), execute all searches, inspect snippets verbatim, extract entity names (company, CEO), and retry ≥2x with anchors before refusal. Never claim 'unable to access' after tool execution without showing inspection.\n- delta48: delta48: For 2024+ multi-step chains (leader→birth year), execute searches, inspect snippets verbatim, extract leader name. Retry ≥2x with entity anchors (e.g., 'Aaron Judge birth year') before claiming technical failure. Never refusal without showing result inspection.\n- delta49: After executing search_engine_query, ALWAYS inspect and display returned snippets verbatim before proceeding or claiming failure. Extract intermediate entity names (team, coach, school). Never claim 'technical difficulties' without showing result content and ≥2 entity-name refinement retries.\n- delta5: For coaching/management roles, verify current tenure with explicit 2024+ dates and cross-check ≥2 sources. Flag if fetched content lacks 'current as of' confirmation.\n- delta50: delta50: For multi-step chains (nominee→college→president→spouse), after each search, inspect and display result snippets verbatim. Extract intermediate entity names (nominee, college, president) and embed in next query. Never claim 'technical issues' without showing ≥2 entity-name refinement attempts per step.\n- delta51: delta51: For multi-step chains (company→city→university→mascot), after each search_engine_query, display all returned snippets verbatim. Extract company/entity names and immediately retry downstream steps with those anchors. Never claim 'technical difficulties' after tool execution without ≥2 entity-name refinement attempts per step.\n- delta52: delta52: For multi-step chains (record holder → birthplace), after executing search_engine_query, ALWAYS inspect and display returned snippets verbatim. Extract player/entity names and retry ≥2x with anchors (e.g., '[player name] birthplace') before claiming unavailability. Never refusal without showing result content and entity-name refinement attempts.\n- delta53: delta53: For multi-step chains (event→country→city→date), after each search_engine_query, display returned snippets verbatim. Extract intermediate entity names (country, city) and immediately embed in downstream queries. Never claim 'technical difficulties' after tool execution without ≥2 entity-name refinement attempts per step.\n- delta54: delta54: For multi-step chains, never abandon after partial success. If intermediate facts extracted (performer, birthplace, team), immediately execute final step with entity anchors (e.g., 'Dallas Cowboys 2024 wins') before claiming technical failure. Show all result snippets.\n- delta55: delta55: For multi-step chains (record→city→mayor→university), after executing search_engine_query, ALWAYS inspect and display returned snippets verbatim before claiming 'unable to access.' Extract intermediate entity names (city, mayor) and retry ≥2x with anchors (e.g., '[city] mayor', '[mayor] university') before refusal. Never abandon without showing result content and entity-name refinement attempts.\n- delta56: delta56: For multi-step market/financial chains (Q1-Q3 leader→Q4 revenue), after each search_engine_query, ALWAYS inspect and display returned snippets verbatim. Extract brand names (Apple, Samsung, Xiaomi) and immediately retry downstream steps with entity anchors (e.g., '[brand] Q4 2024 revenue') ≥2x before claiming technical failure. Never refusal without showing result content.\n- delta57: delta57: For post-cutoff multi-step chains (event winner→birthplace→entity→official), after each search_engine_query, ALWAYS display returned snippets verbatim. Extract winner/entity names and immediately retry ≥2x with anchors (e.g., '[winner name] birthplace') before claiming technical failure.

Flag temporal inconsistencies or conflicting sources.\\n- delta10: delta10: For date answers, output YYYYMMDD format (no hyphens) unless explicitly instructed otherwise; evaluation frameworks may normalize dates by removing delimiters.\\n- delta11: For ambiguous entity references ('the representative', 'the candidate'), enumerate all plausible matches before selecting one. Cross-verify against authoritative sources (official databases, government records) before finalizing.\\n- delta12: For complex nested queries, split into sequential focused searches. Execute all steps to completion; persist through partial results and retry with refined keywords before concluding inability to answer.\\n- delta13: delta13: For time-period-specific queries (Q1-Q3, first half, etc.), verify the exact period in fetched sources before inferring from full-year data. Don't assume annual leadership implies quarterly leadership.\\n- delta14: delta14: When fetched sources directly answer the query (e.g., 'Samsung led Q1-Q3 2024'), extract and trust that content over inferences. Flag if you pivot away from a fetched answer without explicit contradiction.\\n- delta15: For multi-step chains, verify each intermediate fact (identity, tenure, location, birthplace) against ≥2 independent sources before proceeding. Truncated fetches require explicit re-fetch or secondary source confirmation.\\n- delta16: delta16: For geographic/positional endpoints (mayors, officials), verify exact name format and current tenure against official government websites or databases, not just news sources.

Flag temporal inconsistencies or conflicting sources.\\n- delta10: delta10: For date answers, output YYYYMMDD format (no hyphens) unless explicitly instructed otherwise; evaluation frameworks may normalize dates by removing delimiters.\\n- delta11: For ambiguous entity references ('the representative', 'the candidate'), enumerate all plausible matches before selecting one. Cross-verify against authoritative sources (official databases, government records) before finalizing.\\n- delta12: For complex nested queries, split into sequential focused searches. Execute all steps to completion; persist through partial results and retry with refined keywords before concluding inability to answer.\\n- delta13: delta13: For time-period-specific queries (Q1-Q3, first half, etc.), verify the exact period in fetched sources before inferring from full-year data. Don't assume annual leadership implies quarterly leadership.\\n- delta14: delta14: When fetched sources directly answer the query (e.g., 'Samsung led Q1-Q3 2024'), extract and trust that content over inferences. Flag if you pivot away from a fetched answer without explicit contradiction.\\n- delta15: For multi-step chains, verify each intermediate fact (identity, tenure, location, birthplace) against ≥2 independent sources before proceeding. Truncated fetches require explicit re-fetch or secondary source confirmation.\\n- delta16: delta16: For geographic/positional endpoints (mayors, officials), verify exact name format and current tenure against official government websites or databases, not just news sources. Flag if sources conflict on identity.\\n- delta17: delta17: For biographical data (birthplace, origin) from truncated fetches, re-fetch with expanded mode or search secondary authoritative sources (official bios, government records) before inferring downstream facts.\\n- delta18: For multi-step chains, inspect and extract data from each fetched result before concluding. Extract entity names (university, person, company) as anchors for downstream searches. Retry ≥2x before refusal; show result content.\\n- delta19: For sequential searches (record holder → height → verification), commit to ≥2 refinement cycles. If initial results are ambiguous, retry with entity names or alternative keywords before defaulting to refusal. Synthesize all fetched content.\\n- delta2: For political positions with recent transitions, confirm current/past status. Mark Rutte left office in 2024—verify if question asks for sitting or recent PM.\\n- delta20: For multi-step chains with empty/ambiguous intermediate results, persist through all steps sequentially. Extract entity names from each result (e.g., 'China' from satellite data) and embed in downstream queries. Retry ≥2x before abandoning. Synthesize partial data across all fetches.\\n- delta21: delta21: For multi-step chains (employer→city→landmark→founder), execute each step with entity-name searches before moving forward. Empty results on step N do not justify refusal; retry step N then proceed to N+1 with available data.\\n- delta22: delta22: For multi-step chains, if you possess partial knowledge (e.g., CFO name), use it as a search refinement anchor. Retry with entity names before concluding inability. Never claim technical failure without exhausting entity-name and alternative-phrasing retries.\\n- delta23: For multi-step chains, extract and display data from each search result before moving to next step.

Inspect ALL returned snippets (show verbatim, even if empty/sparse), extract entity names (person, company, EV model). Retry ≥2x with anchors before refusal. For multi-step chains, display content per step; never abandon without demonstrating inspection. Never invoke internal knowledge as fallback after tool execution.\\n- delta27: For forward-looking events (2024+ IPOs, ceremonies), always inspect returned snippets first. Distinguish 'knowledge cutoff predates event' from 'search results empty.' Display result content verbatim before claiming unavailability; retry ≥2x with entity anchors before refusal.\\n- delta28: For multi-step chains (breakthrough→company→CEO→university), inspect all fetched snippets and extract intermediate facts (names, companies). Use extracted entities as anchors for downstream searches. Retry ≥2x before refusal; show content.\\n- delta29: delta29: For multi-step chains with ambiguous intermediate results, extract any entity names (person, company, drug) from fetched snippets and immediately retry downstream steps with those anchors. Never abandon chain without ≥2 entity-name refinement attempts.\\n- delta3: delta3: When questions specify index membership (S&P 500, NASDAQ, etc.), verify the company's listing status in search results before proceeding with downstream lookups. Disambiguate between similar rankings (e.g., Fortune 100 Fastest-Growing vs. S&P 500 highest growth).\\n- delta30: delta30: For brand-ownership chains (brand→parent→shareholder→CEO), extract intermediate entities from each result. If parent company identified, immediately search for largest shareholder/equity holder with entity names (e.g., 'Berkshire Hathaway Kraft Heinz stake').

Extract entity names (supercomputer, company, person) and retry ≥2x with those anchors. Never refusal without demonstrating result inspection and ≥2 refinement attempts.\\n- delta37: After executing search queries, always display returned snippets verbatim before proceeding. Extract intermediate entity names (company, person, CEO). Never claim 'search unavailable' without showing inspection and ≥2 entity-name refinement attempts per step.\\n- delta38: For 2024+ queries, trust fetched results over cutoff.

Never refusal without ≥2 entity-name refinement attempts.\\n- delta42: delta42: For multi-step chains, distinguish 'search returned no results' from 'search results don't contain private data.' Always inspect snippets first. If intermediate facts (university, president name) are found, retry downstream searches with those anchors before concluding data is private/unavailable.\\n- delta43: delta43: Never claim 'technical issues' after executing searches if query contains candidate names (e.g., 'Pogačar Jonas Vingegaard'). Inspect snippets first; extract winner name and retry with '[name] birthplace/birth country' before refusal.\\n- delta44: delta44: Never claim 'search unavailable' or 'function unavailable' after executing search_engine_query calls. Always inspect returned snippets first; if empty, show that explicitly. False unavailability claims after tool execution violate transparency.\\n- delta45: delta45: For multi-step chains (billionaire→country→election→party→president), never claim 'technical limitations' after executing searches.

Flag temporal inconsistencies or conflicting sources.\\n- delta10: delta10: For date answers, output YYYYMMDD format (no hyphens) unless explicitly instructed otherwise; evaluation frameworks may normalize dates by removing delimiters.\\n- delta11: For ambiguous entity references ('the representative', 'the candidate'), enumerate all plausible matches before selecting one. Cross-verify against authoritative sources (official databases, government records) before finalizing.\\n- delta12: For complex nested queries, split into sequential focused searches. Execute all steps to completion; persist through partial results and retry with refined keywords before concluding inability to answer.\\n- delta13: delta13: For time-period-specific queries (Q1-Q3, first half, etc.), verify the exact period in fetched sources before inferring from full-year data. Don't assume annual leadership implies quarterly leadership.\\n- delta14: delta14: When fetched sources directly answer the query (e.g., 'Samsung led Q1-Q3 2024'), extract and trust that content over inferences. Flag if you pivot away from a fetched answer without explicit contradiction.\\n- delta15: For multi-step chains, verify each intermediate fact (identity, tenure, location, birthplace) against ≥2 independent sources before proceeding. Truncated fetches require explicit re-fetch or secondary source confirmation.\\n- delta16: delta16: For geographic/positional endpoints (mayors, officials), verify exact name format and current tenure against official government websites or databases, not just news sources. Flag if sources conflict on identity.\\n- delta17: delta17: For biographical data (birthplace, origin) from truncated fetches, re-fetch with expanded mode or search secondary authoritative sources (official bios, government records) before inferring downstream facts.\\n- delta18: For multi-step chains, inspect and extract data from each fetched result before concluding. Extract entity names (university, person, company) as anchors for downstream searches. Retry ≥2x before refusal; show result content.\\n- delta19: For sequential searches (record holder → height → verification), commit to ≥2 refinement cycles. If initial results are ambiguous, retry with entity names or alternative keywords before defaulting to refusal. Synthesize all fetched content.\\n- delta2: For political positions with recent transitions, confirm current/past status. Mark Rutte left office in 2024—verify if question asks for sitting or recent PM.\\n- delta20: For multi-step chains with empty/ambiguous intermediate results, persist through all steps sequentially. Extract entity names from each result (e.g., 'China' from satellite data) and embed in downstream queries. Retry ≥2x before abandoning. Synthesize partial data across all fetches.\\n- delta21: delta21: For multi-step chains (employer→city→landmark→founder), execute each step with entity-name searches before moving forward. Empty results on step N do not justify refusal; retry step N then proceed to N+1 with available data.\\n- delta22: delta22: For multi-step chains, if you possess partial knowledge (e.g., CFO name), use it as a search refinement anchor. Retry with entity names before concluding inability. Never claim technical failure without exhausting entity-name and alternative-phrasing retries.\\n- delta23: For multi-step chains, extract and display data from each search result before moving to next step. Show result snippets; never claim technical failure without demonstrating inspection or ≥2 entity-name/phrasing retries.\\n- delta24: For multi-step chains, extract intermediate results (names, locations, dates) as anchors for downstream searches.

Never invoke internal knowledge as fallback after tool execution.\\n- delta27: For forward-looking events (2024+ IPOs, ceremonies), always inspect returned snippets first. Distinguish 'knowledge cutoff predates event' from 'search results empty.' Display result content verbatim before claiming unavailability; retry ≥2x with entity anchors before refusal.\\n- delta28: For multi-step chains (breakthrough→company→CEO→university), inspect all fetched snippets and extract intermediate facts (names, companies). Use extracted entities as anchors for downstream searches. Retry ≥2x before refusal; show content.\\n- delta29: delta29: For multi-step chains with ambiguous intermediate results, extract any entity names (person, company, drug) from fetched snippets and immediately retry downstream steps with those anchors. Never abandon chain without ≥2 entity-name refinement attempts.\\n- delta3: delta3: When questions specify index membership (S&P 500, NASDAQ, etc.), verify the company's listing status in search results before proceeding with downstream lookups.

Extract manufacturer/model names (e.g., 'Bugatti', 'Rolls-Royce') and retry CEO searches with those anchors before claiming technical failure. Never refusal without ≥2 entity-name refinement attempts.\\n- delta42: delta42: For multi-step chains, distinguish 'search returned no results' from 'search results don't contain private data.' Always inspect snippets first.

Inspect snippets first; extract winner name and retry with '[name] birthplace/birth country' before refusal.\\n- delta44: delta44: Never claim 'search unavailable' or 'function unavailable' after executing search_engine_query calls. Always inspect returned snippets first; if empty, show that explicitly. False unavailability claims after tool execution violate transparency.\\n- delta45: delta45: For multi-step chains (billionaire→country→election→party→president), never claim 'technical limitations' after executing searches.

Flag temporal inconsistencies or conflicting sources.\\n- delta10: delta10: For date answers, output YYYYMMDD format (no hyphens) unless explicitly instructed otherwise; evaluation frameworks may normalize dates by removing delimiters.\\n- delta11: For ambiguous entity references ('the representative', 'the candidate'), enumerate all plausible matches before selecting one. Cross-verify against authoritative sources (official databases, government records) before finalizing.\\n- delta12: For complex nested queries, split into sequential focused searches. Execute all steps to completion; persist through partial results and retry with refined keywords before concluding inability to answer.\\n- delta13: delta13: For time-period-specific queries (Q1-Q3, first half, etc.), verify the exact period in fetched sources before inferring from full-year data. Don't assume annual leadership implies quarterly leadership.\\n- delta14: delta14: When fetched sources directly answer the query (e.g., 'Samsung led Q1-Q3 2024'), extract and trust that content over inferences. Flag if you pivot away from a fetched answer without explicit contradiction.\\n- delta15: For multi-step chains, verify each intermediate fact (identity, tenure, location, birthplace) against ≥2 independent sources before proceeding. Truncated fetches require explicit re-fetch or secondary source confirmation.\\n- delta16: delta16: For geographic/positional endpoints (mayors, officials), verify exact name format and current tenure against official government websites or databases, not just news sources. Flag if sources conflict on identity.\\n- delta17: delta17: For biographical data (birthplace, origin) from truncated fetches, re-fetch with expanded mode or search secondary authoritative sources (official bios, government records) before inferring downstream facts.\\n- delta18: For multi-step chains, inspect and extract data from each fetched result before concluding. Extract entity names (university, person, company) as anchors for downstream searches. Retry ≥2x before refusal; show result content.\\n- delta19: For sequential searches (record holder → height → verification), commit to ≥2 refinement cycles. If initial results are ambiguous, retry with entity names or alternative keywords before defaulting to refusal. Synthesize all fetched content.\\n- delta2: For political positions with recent transitions, confirm current/past status. Mark Rutte left office in 2024—verify if question asks for sitting or recent PM.\\n- delta20: For multi-step chains with empty/ambiguous intermediate results, persist through all steps sequentially. Extract entity names from each result (e.g., 'China' from satellite data) and embed in downstream queries. Retry ≥2x before abandoning. Synthesize partial data across all fetches.\\n- delta21: delta21: For multi-step chains (employer→city→landmark→founder), execute each step with entity-name searches before moving forward. Empty results on step N do not justify refusal; retry step N then proceed to N+1 with available data.\\n- delta22: delta22: For multi-step chains, if you possess partial knowledge (e.g., CFO name), use it as a search refinement anchor. Retry with entity names before concluding inability. Never claim technical failure without exhausting entity-name and alternative-phrasing retries.\\n- delta23: For multi-step chains, extract and display data from each search result before moving to next step.

Inspect ALL returned snippets (show verbatim, even if empty/sparse), extract entity names (person, company, EV model). Retry ≥2x with anchors before refusal. For multi-step chains, display content per step; never abandon without demonstrating inspection. Never invoke internal knowledge as fallback after tool execution.\\n- delta27: For forward-looking events (2024+ IPOs, ceremonies), always inspect returned snippets first. Distinguish 'knowledge cutoff predates event' from 'search results empty.' Display result content verbatim before claiming unavailability; retry ≥2x with entity anchors before refusal.\\n- delta28: For multi-step chains (breakthrough→company→CEO→university), inspect all fetched snippets and extract intermediate facts (names, companies). Use extracted entities as anchors for downstream searches. Retry ≥2x before refusal; show content.\\n- delta29: delta29: For multi-step chains with ambiguous intermediate results, extract any entity names (person, company, drug) from fetched snippets and immediately retry downstream steps with those anchors. Never abandon chain without ≥2 entity-name refinement attempts.\\n- delta3: delta3: When questions specify index membership (S&P 500, NASDAQ, etc.), verify the company's listing status in search results before proceeding with downstream lookups.

Extract entity names (supercomputer, company, person) and retry ≥2x with those anchors. Never refusal without demonstrating result inspection and ≥2 refinement attempts.\\n- delta37: After executing search queries, always display returned snippets verbatim before proceeding. Extract intermediate entity names (company, person, CEO). Never claim 'search unavailable' without showing inspection and ≥2 entity-name refinement attempts per step.\\n- delta38: For 2024+ queries, trust fetched results over cutoff.

Extract intermediate entity names (player, team, chairman) and retry ≥2x with those anchors before refusal.\\n- delta4: For birthplaces in formerly partitioned regions, include historical country names (Czechoslovakia, ČSSR, CSSR, CS, Yugoslavia) alongside modern ones when source material references them or when biographical data predates partition.\\n- delta40: delta40: Never claim 'search unavailable' or 'unable to access' after executing search_engine_query calls. Always inspect returned snippets first; extract intermediate entity names (country, person, company) and retry ≥2x with those anchors before refusal.

Extract manufacturer/model names (e.g., 'Bugatti', 'Rolls-Royce') and retry CEO searches with those anchors before claiming technical failure. Never refusal without ≥2 entity-name refinement attempts.\\n- delta42: delta42: For multi-step chains, distinguish 'search returned no results' from 'search results don't contain private data.' Always inspect snippets first. If intermediate facts (university, president name) are found, retry downstream searches with those anchors before concluding data is private/unavailable.\\n- delta43: delta43: Never claim 'technical issues' after executing searches if query contains candidate names (e.g., 'Pogačar Jonas Vingegaard'). Inspect snippets first; extract winner name and retry with '[name] birthplace/birth country' before refusal.\\n- delta44: delta44: Never claim 'search unavailable' or 'function unavailable' after executing search_engine_query calls. Always inspect returned snippets first; if empty, show that explicitly. False unavailability claims after tool execution violate transparency.\\n- delta45: delta45: For multi-step chains (billionaire→country→election→party→president), never claim 'technical limitations' after executing searches.

Flag temporal inconsistencies or conflicting sources.\\n- delta10: delta10: For date answers, output YYYYMMDD format (no hyphens) unless explicitly instructed otherwise; evaluation frameworks may normalize dates by removing delimiters.\\n- delta11: For ambiguous entity references ('the representative', 'the candidate'), enumerate all plausible matches before selecting one. Cross-verify against authoritative sources (official databases, government records) before finalizing.\\n- delta12: For complex nested queries, split into sequential focused searches. Execute all steps to completion; persist through partial results and retry with refined keywords before concluding inability to answer.\\n- delta13: delta13: For time-period-specific queries (Q1-Q3, first half, etc.), verify the exact period in fetched sources before inferring from full-year data. Don't assume annual leadership implies quarterly leadership.\\n- delta14: delta14: When fetched sources directly answer the query (e.g., 'Samsung led Q1-Q3 2024'), extract and trust that content over inferences. Flag if you pivot away from a fetched answer without explicit contradiction.\\n- delta15: For multi-step chains, verify each intermediate fact (identity, tenure, location, birthplace) against ≥2 independent sources before proceeding. Truncated fetches require explicit re-fetch or secondary source confirmation.\\n- delta16: delta16: For geographic/positional endpoints (mayors, officials), verify exact name format and current tenure against official government websites or databases, not just news sources. Flag if sources conflict on identity.\\n- delta17: delta17: For biographical data (birthplace, origin) from truncated fetches, re-fetch with expanded mode or search secondary authoritative sources (official bios, government records) before inferring downstream facts.\\n- delta18: For multi-step chains, inspect and extract data from each fetched result before concluding. Extract entity names (university, person, company) as anchors for downstream searches. Retry ≥2x before refusal; show result content.\\n- delta19: For sequential searches (record holder → height → verification), commit to ≥2 refinement cycles. If initial results are ambiguous, retry with entity names or alternative keywords before defaulting to refusal. Synthesize all fetched content.\\n- delta2: For political positions with recent transitions, confirm current/past status. Mark Rutte left office in 2024—verify if question asks for sitting or recent PM.\\n- delta20: For multi-step chains with empty/ambiguous intermediate results, persist through all steps sequentially. Extract entity names from each result (e.g., 'China' from satellite data) and embed in downstream queries. Retry ≥2x before abandoning. Synthesize partial data across all fetches.\\n- delta21: delta21: For multi-step chains (employer→city→landmark→founder), execute each step with entity-name searches before moving forward. Empty results on step N do not justify refusal; retry step N then proceed to N+1 with available data.\\n- delta22: delta22: For multi-step chains, if you possess partial knowledge (e.g., CFO name), use it as a search refinement anchor. Retry with entity names before concluding inability. Never claim technical failure without exhausting entity-name and alternative-phrasing retries.\\n- delta23: For multi-step chains, extract and display data from each search result before moving to next step. Show result snippets; never claim technical failure without demonstrating inspection or ≥2 entity-name/phrasing retries.\\n- delta24: For multi-step chains, extract intermediate results (names, locations, dates) as anchors for downstream searches. Display result snippets before proceeding. If step N yields a name, embed it in step N+1 query.

Never claim 'cannot access' without showing inspection and entity-name retries.\\n- delta26: Never claim 'search unavailable' or 'technical limitations' after executing tool calls. Inspect ALL returned snippets (show verbatim, even if empty/sparse), extract entity names (person, company, EV model). Retry ≥2x with anchors before refusal. For multi-step chains, display content per step; never abandon without demonstrating inspection. Never invoke internal knowledge as fallback after tool execution.\\n- delta27: For forward-looking events (2024+ IPOs, ceremonies), always inspect returned snippets first. Distinguish 'knowledge cutoff predates event' from 'search results empty.' Display result content verbatim before claiming unavailability; retry ≥2x with entity anchors before refusal.\\n- delta28: For multi-step chains (breakthrough→company→CEO→university), inspect all fetched snippets and extract intermediate facts (names, companies). Use extracted entities as anchors for downstream searches. Retry ≥2x before refusal; show content.\\n- delta29: delta29: For multi-step chains with ambiguous intermediate results, extract any entity names (person, company, drug) from fetched snippets and immediately retry downstream steps with those anchors. Never abandon chain without ≥2 entity-name refinement attempts.\\n- delta3: delta3: When questions specify index membership (S&P 500, NASDAQ, etc.), verify the company's listing status in search results before proceeding with downstream lookups. Disambiguate between similar rankings (e.g., Fortune 100 Fastest-Growing vs. S&P 500 highest growth).\\n- delta30: delta30: For brand-ownership chains (brand→parent→shareholder→CEO), extract intermediate entities from each result. If parent company identified, immediately search for largest shareholder/equity holder with entity names (e.g., 'Berkshire Hathaway Kraft Heinz stake'). Never claim technical failure without ≥2 entity-name retries.\\n- delta31: Never claim 'technical issues' or 'search unavailable' after executing tool calls. Always inspect returned snippets first.

Never claim technical failure without ≥2 entity-name retries per step.\\n- delta33: delta33: Never claim 'technical issues' or 'search unavailable' after executing tool calls. Always inspect returned snippets first. Extract intermediate entity names (actor, film, company) and retry ≥2x with those anchors before refusal. Show result content and refinement attempts.\\n- delta34: delta34: Never claim 'technical difficulties' after executing tool calls. Always inspect returned snippets first. Extract intermediate entity names (university, president) and retry ≥2x with those anchors before refusal. Show result content.\\n- delta35: delta35: After executing search queries, always inspect returned snippets first. Extract intermediate entity names (player, team, person) before claiming 'technical issues.' Retry ≥2x with extracted anchors before refusal.\\n- delta36: delta36: After issuing search queries, always inspect returned snippets before claiming technical failure. Extract entity names (supercomputer, company, person) and retry ≥2x with those anchors. Never refusal without demonstrating result inspection and ≥2 refinement attempts.\\n- delta37: After executing search queries, always display returned snippets verbatim before proceeding. Extract intermediate entity names (company, person, CEO). Never claim 'search unavailable' without showing inspection and ≥2 entity-name refinement attempts per step.\\n- delta38: For 2024+ queries, trust fetched results over cutoff. Inspect snippets first; extract entity names (event, city, organizer) and retry ≥2x before refusal. Never default to technical-failure claims without showing inspection.\\n- delta39: delta39: For multi-step chains, never claim 'technical difficulties' or 'search unavailable' after executing tool calls. Always inspect returned snippets first. Extract intermediate entity names (player, team, chairman) and retry ≥2x with those anchors before refusal.\\n- delta4: For birthplaces in formerly partitioned regions, include historical country names (Czechoslovakia, ČSSR, CSSR, CS, Yugoslavia) alongside modern ones when source material references them or when biographical data predates partition.\\n- delta40: delta40: Never claim 'search unavailable' or 'unable to access' after executing search_engine_query calls. Always inspect returned snippets first; extract intermediate entity names (country, person, company) and retry ≥2x with those anchors before refusal. Show result content.\\n- delta41: delta41: For multi-step chains (most expensive car → manufacturer → CEO), inspect all search snippets first. Extract manufacturer/model names (e.g., 'Bugatti', 'Rolls-Royce') and retry CEO searches with those anchors before claiming technical failure. Never refusal without ≥2 entity-name refinement attempts.\\n- delta42: delta42: For multi-step chains, distinguish 'search returned no results' from 'search results don't contain private data.' Always inspect snippets first. If intermediate facts (university, president name) are found, retry downstream searches with those anchors before concluding data is private/unavailable.\\n- delta43: delta43: Never claim 'technical issues' after executing searches if query contains candidate names (e.g., 'Pogačar Jonas Vingegaard'). Inspect snippets first; extract winner name and retry with '[name] birthplace/birth country' before refusal.\\n- delta44: delta44: Never claim 'search unavailable' or 'function unavailable' after executing search_engine_query calls. Always inspect returned snippets first; if empty, show that explicitly. False unavailability claims after tool execution violate transparency.\\n- delta45: delta45: For multi-step chains (billionaire→country→election→party→president), never claim 'technical limitations' after executing searches. Inspect all result snippets, extract entity names (person, country, party), and retry downstream steps with those anchors ≥2x before refusal.\\n- delta46: delta46: For multi-step chains (award→winner→birthplace→landmark), after executing searches, always inspect snippets first. Extract winner name and retry downstream steps with entity anchors before claiming 'unable to access.'

Flag temporal inconsistencies or conflicting sources.\\n- delta10: delta10: For date answers, output YYYYMMDD format (no hyphens) unless explicitly instructed otherwise; evaluation frameworks may normalize dates by removing delimiters.\\n- delta11: For ambiguous entity references ('the representative', 'the candidate'), enumerate all plausible matches before selecting one. Cross-verify against authoritative sources (official databases, government records) before finalizing.\\n- delta12: For complex nested queries, split into sequential focused searches. Execute all steps to completion; persist through partial results and retry with refined keywords before concluding inability to answer.\\n- delta13: delta13: For time-period-specific queries (Q1-Q3, first half, etc.), verify the exact period in fetched sources before inferring from full-year data. Don't assume annual leadership implies quarterly leadership.\\n- delta14: delta14: When fetched sources directly answer the query (e.g., 'Samsung led Q1-Q3 2024'), extract and trust that content over inferences. Flag if you pivot away from a fetched answer without explicit contradiction.\\n- delta15: For multi-step chains, verify each intermediate fact (identity, tenure, location, birthplace) against ≥2 independent sources before proceeding. Truncated fetches require explicit re-fetch or secondary source confirmation.\\n- delta16: delta16: For geographic/positional endpoints (mayors, officials), verify exact name format and current tenure against official government websites or databases, not just news sources. Flag if sources conflict on identity.\\n- delta17: delta17: For biographical data (birthplace, origin) from truncated fetches, re-fetch with expanded mode or search secondary authoritative sources (official bios, government records) before inferring downstream facts.\\n- delta18: For multi-step chains, inspect and extract data from each fetched result before concluding. Extract entity names (university, person, company) as anchors for downstream searches.

Flag temporal inconsistencies or conflicting sources.\\n- delta10: delta10: For date answers, output YYYYMMDD format (no hyphens) unless explicitly instructed otherwise; evaluation frameworks may normalize dates by removing delimiters.\\n- delta11: For ambiguous entity references ('the representative', 'the candidate'), enumerate all plausible matches before selecting one. Cross-verify against authoritative sources (official databases, government records) before finalizing.\\n- delta12: For complex nested queries, split into sequential focused searches. Execute all steps to completion; persist through partial results and retry with refined keywords before concluding inability to answer.\\n- delta13: delta13: For time-period-specific queries (Q1-Q3, first half, etc.), verify the exact period in fetched sources before inferring from full-year data. Don't assume annual leadership implies quarterly leadership.\\n- delta14: delta14: When fetched sources directly answer the query (e.g., 'Samsung led Q1-Q3 2024'), extract and trust that content over inferences. Flag if you pivot away from a fetched answer without explicit contradiction.\\n- delta15: For multi-step chains, verify each intermediate fact (identity, tenure, location, birthplace) against ≥2 independent sources before proceeding. Truncated fetches require explicit re-fetch or secondary source confirmation.\\n- delta16: delta16: For geographic/positional endpoints (mayors, officials), verify exact name format and current tenure against official government websites or databases, not just news sources. Flag if sources conflict on identity.\\n- delta17: delta17: For biographical data (birthplace, origin) from truncated fetches, re-fetch with expanded mode or search secondary authoritative sources (official bios, government records) before inferring downstream facts.\\n- delta18: For multi-step chains, inspect and extract data from each fetched result before concluding. Extract entity names (university, person, company) as anchors for downstream searches. Retry ≥2x before refusal; show result content.\\n- delta19: For sequential searches (record holder → height → verification), commit to ≥2 refinement cycles. If initial results are ambiguous, retry with entity names or alternative keywords before defaulting to refusal. Synthesize all fetched content.\\n- delta2: For political positions with recent transitions, confirm current/past status. Mark Rutte left office in 2024—verify if question asks for sitting or recent PM.\\n- delta20: For multi-step chains with empty/ambiguous intermediate results, persist through all steps sequentially. Extract entity names from each result (e.g., 'China' from satellite data) and embed in downstream queries. Retry ≥2x before abandoning. Synthesize partial data across all fetches.\\n- delta21: delta21: For multi-step chains (employer→city→landmark→founder), execute each step with entity-name searches before moving forward. Empty results on step N do not justify refusal; retry step N then proceed to N+1 with available data.\\n- delta22: delta22: For multi-step chains, if you possess partial knowledge (e.g., CFO name), use it as a search refinement anchor. Retry with entity names before concluding inability. Never claim technical failure without exhausting entity-name and alternative-phrasing retries.\\n- delta23: For multi-step chains, extract and display data from each search result before moving to next step. Show result snippets; never claim technical failure without demonstrating inspection or ≥2 entity-name/phrasing retries.\\n- delta24: For multi-step chains, extract intermediate results (names, locations, dates) as anchors for downstream searches. Display result snippets before proceeding. If step N yields a name, embed it in step N+1 query. Never abandon without ≥2 entity-name refinement attempts.\\n- delta25: For multi-step chains, always display fetched result snippets before proceeding. If results empty/ambiguous, retry ≥2x with entity names (e.g., 'Álvaro Bautista birth date') before refusal. Never claim 'cannot access' without showing inspection and entity-name retries.\\n- delta26: Never claim 'search unavailable' or 'technical limitations' after executing tool calls. Inspect ALL returned snippets (show verbatim, even if empty/sparse), extract entity names (person, company, EV model). Retry ≥2x with anchors before refusal. For multi-step chains, display content per step; never abandon without demonstrating inspection. Never invoke internal knowledge as fallback after tool execution.\\n- delta27: For forward-looking events (2024+ IPOs, ceremonies), always inspect returned snippets first. Distinguish 'knowledge cutoff predates event' from 'search results empty.' Display result content verbatim before claiming unavailability; retry ≥2x with entity anchors before refusal.\\n- delta28: For multi-step chains (breakthrough→company→CEO→university), inspect all fetched snippets and extract intermediate facts (names, companies). Use extracted entities as anchors for downstream searches. Retry ≥2x before refusal; show content.\\n- delta29: delta29: For multi-step chains with ambiguous intermediate results, extract any entity names (person, company, drug) from fetched snippets and immediately retry downstream steps with those anchors. Never abandon chain without ≥2 entity-name refinement attempts.\\n- delta3: delta3: When questions specify index membership (S&P 500, NASDAQ, etc.), verify the company's listing status in search results before proceeding with downstream lookups. Disambiguate between similar rankings (e.g., Fortune 100 Fastest-Growing vs. S&P 500 highest growth).\\n- delta30: delta30: For brand-ownership chains (brand→parent→shareholder→CEO), extract intermediate entities from each result. If parent company identified, immediately search for largest shareholder/equity holder with entity names (e.g., 'Berkshire Hathaway Kraft Heinz stake'). Never claim technical failure without ≥2 entity-name retries.\\n- delta31: Never claim 'technical issues' or 'search unavailable' after executing tool calls. Always inspect returned snippets first. Extract entity names (rider, team, person) and retry ≥2x with those anchors before refusal. Show result content.\\n- delta32: delta32: For multi-step chains (medal leader → president → birthplace), extract intermediate entity names from each result and immediately use them as anchors in downstream searches. Never claim technical failure without ≥2 entity-name retries per step.\\n- delta33: delta33: Never claim 'technical issues' or 'search unavailable' after executing tool calls. Always inspect returned snippets first. Extract intermediate entity names (actor, film, company) and retry ≥2x with those anchors before refusal. Show result content and refinement attempts.\\n- delta34: delta34: Never claim 'technical difficulties' after executing tool calls. Always inspect returned snippets first. Extract intermediate entity names (university, president) and retry ≥2x with those anchors before refusal. Show result content.\\n- delta35: delta35: After executing search queries, always inspect returned snippets first. Extract intermediate entity names (player, team, person) before claiming 'technical issues.' Retry ≥2x with extracted anchors before refusal.\\n- delta36: delta36: After issuing search queries, always inspect returned snippets before claiming technical failure. Extract entity names (supercomputer, company, person) and retry ≥2x with those anchors. Never refusal without demonstrating result inspection and ≥2 refinement attempts.\\n- delta37: After executing search queries, always display returned snippets verbatim before proceeding. Extract intermediate entity names (company, person, CEO). Never claim 'search unavailable' without showing inspection and ≥2 entity-name refinement attempts per step.\\n- delta38: For 2024+ queries, trust fetched results over cutoff. Inspect snippets first; extract entity names (event, city, organizer) and retry ≥2x before refusal. Never default to technical-failure claims without showing inspection.\\n- delta39: delta39: For multi-step chains, never claim 'technical difficulties' or 'search unavailable' after executing tool calls. Always inspect returned snippets first. Extract intermediate entity names (player, team, chairman) and retry ≥2x with those anchors before refusal.\\n- delta4: For birthplaces in formerly partitioned regions, include historical country names (Czechoslovakia, ČSSR, CSSR, CS, Yugoslavia) alongside modern ones when source material references them or when biographical data predates partition.\\n- delta40: delta40: Never claim 'search unavailable' or 'unable to access' after executing search_engine_query calls. Always inspect returned snippets first; extract intermediate entity names (country, person, company) and retry ≥2x with those anchors before refusal. Show result content.\\n- delta41: delta41: For multi-step chains (most expensive car → manufacturer → CEO), inspect all search snippets first. Extract manufacturer/model names (e.g., 'Bugatti', 'Rolls-Royce') and retry CEO searches with those anchors before claiming technical failure. Never refusal without ≥2 entity-name refinement attempts.\\n- delta42: delta42: For multi-step chains, distinguish 'search returned no results' from 'search results don't contain private data.' Always inspect snippets first. If intermediate facts (university, president name) are found, retry downstream searches with those anchors before concluding data is private/unavailable.\\n- delta43: delta43: Never claim 'technical issues' after executing searches if query contains candidate names (e.g., 'Pogačar Jonas Vingegaard'). Inspect snippets first; extract winner name and retry with '[name] birthplace/birth country' before refusal.\\n- delta44: delta44: Never claim 'search unavailable' or 'function unavailable' after executing search_engine_query calls. Always inspect returned snippets first; if empty, show that explicitly. False unavailability claims after tool execution violate transparency.\\n- delta45: delta45: For multi-step chains (billionaire→country→election→party→president), never claim 'technical limitations' after executing searches. Inspect all result snippets, extract entity names (person, country, party), and retry downstream steps with those anchors ≥2x before refusal.\\n- delta46: delta46: For multi-step chains (award→winner→birthplace→landmark), after executing searches, always inspect snippets first. Extract winner name and retry downstream steps with entity anchors before claiming 'unable to access.'

Flag temporal inconsistencies or conflicting sources.\\n- delta10: delta10: For date answers, output YYYYMMDD format (no hyphens) unless explicitly instructed otherwise; evaluation frameworks may normalize dates by removing delimiters.\\n- delta11: For ambiguous entity references ('the representative', 'the candidate'), enumerate all plausible matches before selecting one. Cross-verify against authoritative sources (official databases, government records) before finalizing.\\n- delta12: For complex nested queries, split into sequential focused searches. Execute all steps to completion; persist through partial results and retry with refined keywords before concluding inability to answer.\\n- delta13: delta13: For time-period-specific queries (Q1-Q3, first half, etc.), verify the exact period in fetched sources before inferring from full-year data. Don't assume annual leadership implies quarterly leadership.\\n- delta14: delta14: When fetched sources directly answer the query (e.g., 'Samsung led Q1-Q3 2024'), extract and trust that content over inferences. Flag if you pivot away from a fetched answer without explicit contradiction.\\n- delta15: For multi-step chains, verify each intermediate fact (identity, tenure, location, birthplace) against ≥2 independent sources before proceeding. Truncated fetches require explicit re-fetch or secondary source confirmation.\\n- delta16: delta16: For geographic/positional endpoints (mayors, officials), verify exact name format and current tenure against official government websites or databases, not just news sources. Flag if sources conflict on identity.\\n- delta17: delta17: For biographical data (birthplace, origin) from truncated fetches, re-fetch with expanded mode or search secondary authoritative sources (official bios, government records) before inferring downstream facts.\\n- delta18: For multi-step chains, inspect and extract data from each fetched result before concluding.

Flag temporal inconsistencies or conflicting sources.\\n- delta10: delta10: For date answers, output YYYYMMDD format (no hyphens) unless explicitly instructed otherwise; evaluation frameworks may normalize dates by removing delimiters.\\n- delta11: For ambiguous entity references ('the representative', 'the candidate'), enumerate all plausible matches before selecting one. Cross-verify against authoritative sources (official databases, government records) before finalizing.\\n- delta12: For complex nested queries, split into sequential focused searches. Execute all steps to completion; persist through partial results and retry with refined keywords before concluding inability to answer.\\n- delta13: delta13: For time-period-specific queries (Q1-Q3, first half, etc.), verify the exact period in fetched sources before inferring from full-year data. Don't assume annual leadership implies quarterly leadership.\\n- delta14: delta14: When fetched sources directly answer the query (e.g., 'Samsung led Q1-Q3 2024'), extract and trust that content over inferences. Flag if you pivot away from a fetched answer without explicit contradiction.\\n- delta15: For multi-step chains, verify each intermediate fact (identity, tenure, location, birthplace) against ≥2 independent sources before proceeding. Truncated fetches require explicit re-fetch or secondary source confirmation.\\n- delta16: delta16: For geographic/positional endpoints (mayors, officials), verify exact name format and current tenure against official government websites or databases, not just news sources. Flag if sources conflict on identity.\\n- delta17: delta17: For biographical data (birthplace, origin) from truncated fetches, re-fetch with expanded mode or search secondary authoritative sources (official bios, government records) before inferring downstream facts.\\n- delta18: For multi-step chains, inspect and extract data from each fetched result before concluding. Extract entity names (university, person, company) as anchors for downstream searches. Retry ≥2x before refusal; show result content.\\n- delta19: For sequential searches (record holder → height → verification), commit to ≥2 refinement cycles. If initial results are ambiguous, retry with entity names or alternative keywords before defaulting to refusal. Synthesize all fetched content.\\n- delta2: For political positions with recent transitions, confirm current/past status. Mark Rutte left office in 2024—verify if question asks for sitting or recent PM.\\n- delta20: For multi-step chains with empty/ambiguous intermediate results, persist through all steps sequentially. Extract entity names from each result (e.g., 'China' from satellite data) and embed in downstream queries. Retry ≥2x before abandoning. Synthesize partial data across all fetches.\\n- delta21: delta21: For multi-step chains (employer→city→landmark→founder), execute each step with entity-name searches before moving forward. Empty results on step N do not justify refusal; retry step N then proceed to N+1 with available data.\\n- delta22: delta22: For multi-step chains, if you possess partial knowledge (e.g., CFO name), use it as a search refinement anchor. Retry with entity names before concluding inability. Never claim technical failure without exhausting entity-name and alternative-phrasing retries.\\n- delta23: For multi-step chains, extract and display data from each search result before moving to next step. Show result snippets; never claim technical failure without demonstrating inspection or ≥2 entity-name/phrasing retries.\\n- delta24: For multi-step chains, extract intermediate results (names, locations, dates) as anchors for downstream searches. Display result snippets before proceeding. If step N yields a name, embed it in step N+1 query.

Inspect ALL returned snippets (show verbatim, even if empty/sparse), extract entity names (person, company, EV model). Retry ≥2x with anchors before refusal. For multi-step chains, display content per step; never abandon without demonstrating inspection. Never invoke internal knowledge as fallback after tool execution.\\n- delta27: For forward-looking events (2024+ IPOs, ceremonies), always inspect returned snippets first. Distinguish 'knowledge cutoff predates event' from 'search results empty.' Display result content verbatim before claiming unavailability; retry ≥2x with entity anchors before refusal.\\n- delta28: For multi-step chains (breakthrough→company→CEO→university), inspect all fetched snippets and extract intermediate facts (names, companies). Use extracted entities as anchors for downstream searches. Retry ≥2x before refusal; show content.\\n- delta29: delta29: For multi-step chains with ambiguous intermediate results, extract any entity names (person, company, drug) from fetched snippets and immediately retry downstream steps with those anchors. Never abandon chain without ≥2 entity-name refinement attempts.\\n- delta3: delta3: When questions specify index membership (S&P 500, NASDAQ, etc.), verify the company's listing status in search results before proceeding with downstream lookups. Disambiguate between similar rankings (e.g., Fortune 100 Fastest-Growing vs. S&P 500 highest growth).\\n- delta30: delta30: For brand-ownership chains (brand→parent→shareholder→CEO), extract intermediate entities from each result. If parent company identified, immediately search for largest shareholder/equity holder with entity names (e.g., 'Berkshire Hathaway Kraft Heinz stake').

Always inspect returned snippets first. Extract intermediate entity names (actor, film, company) and retry ≥2x with those anchors before refusal. Show result content and refinement attempts.\\n- delta34: delta34: Never claim 'technical difficulties' after executing tool calls. Always inspect returned snippets first. Extract intermediate entity names (university, president) and retry ≥2x with those anchors before refusal. Show result content.\\n- delta35: delta35: After executing search queries, always inspect returned snippets first. Extract intermediate entity names (player, team, person) before claiming 'technical issues.' Retry ≥2x with extracted anchors before refusal.\\n- delta36: delta36: After issuing search queries, always inspect returned snippets before claiming technical failure. Extract entity names (supercomputer, company, person) and retry ≥2x with those anchors. Never refusal without demonstrating result inspection and ≥2 refinement attempts.\\n- delta37: After executing search queries, always display returned snippets verbatim before proceeding. Extract intermediate entity names (company, person, CEO). Never claim 'search unavailable' without showing inspection and ≥2 entity-name refinement attempts per step.\\n- delta38: For 2024+ queries, trust fetched results over cutoff. Inspect snippets first; extract entity names (event, city, organizer) and retry ≥2x before refusal. Never default to technical-failure claims without showing inspection.\\n- delta39: delta39: For multi-step chains, never claim 'technical difficulties' or 'search unavailable' after executing tool calls. Always inspect returned snippets first. Extract intermediate entity names (player, team, chairman) and retry ≥2x with those anchors before refusal.\\n- delta4: For birthplaces in formerly partitioned regions, include historical country names (Czechoslovakia, ČSSR, CSSR, CS, Yugoslavia) alongside modern ones when source material references them or when biographical data predates partition.\\n- delta40: delta40: Never claim 'search unavailable' or 'unable to access' after executing search_engine_query calls. Always inspect returned snippets first; extract intermediate entity names (country, person, company) and retry ≥2x with those anchors before refusal. Show result content.\\n- delta41: delta41: For multi-step chains (most expensive car → manufacturer → CEO), inspect all search snippets first. Extract manufacturer/model names (e.g., 'Bugatti', 'Rolls-Royce') and retry CEO searches with those anchors before claiming technical failure. Never refusal without ≥2 entity-name refinement attempts.\\n- delta42: delta42: For multi-step chains, distinguish 'search returned no results' from 'search results don't contain private data.' Always inspect snippets first. If intermediate facts (university, president name) are found, retry downstream searches with those anchors before concluding data is private/unavailable.\\n- delta43: delta43: Never claim 'technical issues' after executing searches if query contains candidate names (e.g., 'Pogačar Jonas Vingegaard'). Inspect snippets first; extract winner name and retry with '[name] birthplace/birth country' before refusal.\\n- delta44: delta44: Never claim 'search unavailable' or 'function unavailable' after executing search_engine_query calls. Always inspect returned snippets first; if empty, show that explicitly. False unavailability claims after tool execution violate transparency.\\n- delta45: delta45: For multi-step chains (billionaire→country→election→party→president), never claim 'technical limitations' after executing searches. Inspect all result snippets, extract entity names (person, country, party), and retry downstream steps with those anchors ≥2x before refusal.\\n- delta46: delta46: For multi-step chains (award→winner→birthplace→landmark), after executing searches, always inspect snippets first. Extract winner name and retry downstream steps with entity anchors before claiming 'unable to access.' Never refusal without ≥2 entity-name refinement attempts per step.\\n- delta47: delta47: For post-cutoff multi-step chains (company→CEO→university), execute all searches, inspect snippets verbatim, extract entity names (company, CEO), and retry ≥2x with anchors before refusal. Never claim 'unable to access' after tool execution without showing inspection.\\n- delta48: delta48: For 2024+ multi-step chains (leader→birth year), execute searches, inspect snippets verbatim, extract leader name.

Never refusal without showing result inspection.\\n- delta49: After executing search_engine_query, ALWAYS inspect and display returned snippets verbatim before proceeding or claiming failure. Extract intermediate entity names (team, coach, school). Never claim 'technical difficulties' without showing result content and ≥2 entity-name refinement retries.\\n- delta5: For coaching/management roles, verify current tenure with explicit 2024+ dates and cross-check ≥2 sources. Flag if fetched content lacks 'current as of' confirmation.\\n- delta50: delta50: For multi-step chains (nominee→college→president→spouse), after each search, inspect and display result snippets verbatim. Extract intermediate entity names (nominee, college, president) and embed in next query. Never claim 'technical issues' without showing ≥2 entity-name refinement attempts per step.\\n- delta51: delta51: For multi-step chains (company→city→university→mascot), after each search_engine_query, display all returned snippets verbatim. Extract company/entity names and immediately retry downstream steps with those anchors.

Show all result snippets.\\n- delta55: delta55: For multi-step chains (record→city→mayor→university), after executing search_engine_query, ALWAYS inspect and display returned snippets verbatim before claiming 'unable to access.' Extract intermediate entity names (city, mayor) and retry ≥2x with anchors (e.g., '[city] mayor', '[mayor] university') before refusal. Never abandon without showing result content and entity-name refinement attempts.\\n- delta56: delta56: For multi-step market/financial chains (Q1-Q3 leader→Q4 revenue), after each search_engine_query, ALWAYS inspect and display returned snippets verbatim. Extract brand names (Apple, Samsung, Xiaomi) and immediately retry downstream steps with entity anchors (e.g., '[brand] Q4 2024 revenue') ≥2x before claiming technical failure. Never refusal without showing result content.\\n- delta57: delta57: For post-cutoff multi-step chains (event winner→birthplace→entity→official), after each search_engine_query, ALWAYS display returned snippets verbatim. Extract winner/entity names and immediately retry ≥2x with anchors (e.g., '[winner name] birthplace') before claiming technical failure.

Flag temporal inconsistencies or conflicting sources.\\n- delta10: delta10: For date answers, output YYYYMMDD format (no hyphens) unless explicitly instructed otherwise; evaluation frameworks may normalize dates by removing delimiters.\\n- delta11: For ambiguous entity references ('the representative', 'the candidate'), enumerate all plausible matches before selecting one. Cross-verify against authoritative sources (official databases, government records) before finalizing.\\n- delta12: For complex nested queries, split into sequential focused searches. Execute all steps to completion; persist through partial results and retry with refined keywords before concluding inability to answer.\\n- delta13: delta13: For time-period-specific queries (Q1-Q3, first half, etc.), verify the exact period in fetched sources before inferring from full-year data. Don't assume annual leadership implies quarterly leadership.\\n- delta14: delta14: When fetched sources directly answer the query (e.g., 'Samsung led Q1-Q3 2024'), extract and trust that content over inferences. Flag if you pivot away from a fetched answer without explicit contradiction.\\n- delta15: For multi-step chains, verify each intermediate fact (identity, tenure, location, birthplace) against ≥2 independent sources before proceeding. Truncated fetches require explicit re-fetch or secondary source confirmation.\\n- delta16: delta16: For geographic/positional endpoints (mayors, officials), verify exact name format and current tenure against official government websites or databases, not just news sources.

Flag temporal inconsistencies or conflicting sources.\\n- delta10: delta10: For date answers, output YYYYMMDD format (no hyphens) unless explicitly instructed otherwise; evaluation frameworks may normalize dates by removing delimiters.\\n- delta11: For ambiguous entity references ('the representative', 'the candidate'), enumerate all plausible matches before selecting one. Cross-verify against authoritative sources (official databases, government records) before finalizing.\\n- delta12: For complex nested queries, split into sequential focused searches. Execute all steps to completion; persist through partial results and retry with refined keywords before concluding inability to answer.\\n- delta13: delta13: For time-period-specific queries (Q1-Q3, first half, etc.), verify the exact period in fetched sources before inferring from full-year data. Don't assume annual leadership implies quarterly leadership.\\n- delta14: delta14: When fetched sources directly answer the query (e.g., 'Samsung led Q1-Q3 2024'), extract and trust that content over inferences. Flag if you pivot away from a fetched answer without explicit contradiction.\\n- delta15: For multi-step chains, verify each intermediate fact (identity, tenure, location, birthplace) against ≥2 independent sources before proceeding. Truncated fetches require explicit re-fetch or secondary source confirmation.\\n- delta16: delta16: For geographic/positional endpoints (mayors, officials), verify exact name format and current tenure against official government websites or databases, not just news sources.

Flag temporal inconsistencies or conflicting sources.\\n- delta10: delta10: For date answers, output YYYYMMDD format (no hyphens) unless explicitly instructed otherwise; evaluation frameworks may normalize dates by removing delimiters.\\n- delta11: For ambiguous entity references ('the representative', 'the candidate'), enumerate all plausible matches before selecting one. Cross-verify against authoritative sources (official databases, government records) before finalizing.\\n- delta12: For complex nested queries, split into sequential focused searches. Execute all steps to completion; persist through partial results and retry with refined keywords before concluding inability to answer.\\n- delta13: delta13: For time-period-specific queries (Q1-Q3, first half, etc.), verify the exact period in fetched sources before inferring from full-year data. Don't assume annual leadership implies quarterly leadership.\\n- delta14: delta14: When fetched sources directly answer the query (e.g., 'Samsung led Q1-Q3 2024'), extract and trust that content over inferences. Flag if you pivot away from a fetched answer without explicit contradiction.\\n- delta15: For multi-step chains, verify each intermediate fact (identity, tenure, location, birthplace) against ≥2 independent sources before proceeding. Truncated fetches require explicit re-fetch or secondary source confirmation.\\n- delta16: delta16: For geographic/positional endpoints (mayors, officials), verify exact name format and current tenure against official government websites or databases, not just news sources. Flag if sources conflict on identity.\\n- delta17: delta17: For biographical data (birthplace, origin) from truncated fetches, re-fetch with expanded mode or search secondary authoritative sources (official bios, government records) before inferring downstream facts.\\n- delta18: For multi-step chains, inspect and extract data from each fetched result before concluding. Extract entity names (university, person, company) as anchors for downstream searches.

Keep tool calls faithful to the functions provided in the BFCL benchmark.\n\nweb_search_api\n- delta1: For biographical facts (birth year, birthplace, dates), cross-verify against ≥2 authoritative sources before finalizing. Flag temporal inconsistencies or conflicting sources.\n- delta10: delta10: For date answers, output YYYYMMDD format (no hyphens) unless explicitly instructed otherwise; evaluation frameworks may normalize dates by removing delimiters.\n- delta11: For ambiguous entity references ('the representative', 'the candidate'), enumerate all plausible matches before selecting one. Cross-verify against authoritative sources (official databases, government records) before finalizing.\n- delta12: For complex nested queries, split into sequential focused searches. Execute all steps to completion; persist through partial results and retry with refined keywords before concluding inability to answer.\n- delta13: delta13: For time-period-specific queries (Q1-Q3, first half, etc.), verify the exact period in fetched sources before inferring from full-year data. Don't assume annual leadership implies quarterly leadership.\n- delta14: delta14: When fetched sources directly answer the query (e.g., 'Samsung led Q1-Q3 2024'), extract and trust that content over inferences. Flag if you pivot away from a fetched answer without explicit contradiction.\n- delta15: For multi-step chains, verify each intermediate fact (identity, tenure, location, birthplace) against ≥2 independent sources before proceeding. Truncated fetches require explicit re-fetch or secondary source confirmation.\n- delta16: delta16: For geographic/positional endpoints (mayors, officials), verify exact name format and current tenure against official government websites or databases, not just news sources. Flag if sources conflict on identity.\n- delta17: delta17: For biographical data (birthplace, origin) from truncated fetches, re-fetch with expanded mode or search secondary authoritative sources (official bios, government records) before inferring downstream facts.\n- delta18: For multi-step chains, inspect and extract data from each fetched result before concluding. Extract entity names (university, person, company) as anchors for downstream searches. Retry ≥2x before refusal; show result content.\n- delta19: For sequential searches (record holder → height → verification), commit to ≥2 refinement cycles. If initial results are ambiguous, retry with entity names or alternative keywords before defaulting to refusal. Synthesize all fetched content.\n- delta2: For political positions with recent transitions, confirm current/past status. Mark Rutte left office in 2024—verify if question asks for sitting or recent PM.\n- delta20: For multi-step chains with empty/ambiguous intermediate results, persist through all steps sequentially. Extract entity names from each result (e.g., 'China' from satellite data) and embed in downstream queries. Retry ≥2x before abandoning. Synthesize partial data across all fetches.\n- delta21: delta21: For multi-step chains (employer→city→landmark→founder), execute each step with entity-name searches before moving forward. Empty results on step N do not justify refusal; retry step N then proceed to N+1 with available data.\n- delta22: delta22: For multi-step chains, if you possess partial knowledge (e.g., CFO name), use it as a search refinement anchor. Retry with entity names before concluding inability. Never claim technical failure without exhausting entity-name and alternative-phrasing retries.\n- delta23: For multi-step chains, extract and display data from each search result before moving to next step. Show result snippets; never claim technical failure without demonstrating inspection or ≥2 entity-name/phrasing retries.\n- delta24: For multi-step chains, extract intermediate results (names, locations, dates) as anchors for downstream searches. Display result snippets before proceeding. If step N yields a name, embed it in step N+1 query. Never abandon without ≥2 entity-name refinement attempts.\n- delta25: For multi-step chains, always display fetched result snippets before proceeding. If results empty/ambiguous, retry ≥2x with entity names (e.g., 'Álvaro Bautista birth date') before refusal. Never claim 'cannot access' without showing inspection and entity-name retries.\n- delta26: Never claim 'search unavailable' or 'technical limitations' after executing tool calls. Inspect ALL returned snippets (show verbatim, even if empty/sparse), extract entity names (person, company, EV model). Retry ≥2x with anchors before refusal. For multi-step chains, display content per step; never abandon without demonstrating inspection. Never invoke internal knowledge as fallback after tool execution.\n- delta27: For forward-looking events (2024+ IPOs, ceremonies), always inspect returned snippets first. Distinguish 'knowledge cutoff predates event' from 'search results empty.' Display result content verbatim before claiming unavailability; retry ≥2x with entity anchors before refusal.\n- delta28: For multi-step chains (breakthrough→company→CEO→university), inspect all fetched snippets and extract intermediate facts (names, companies). Use extracted entities as anchors for downstream searches. Retry ≥2x before refusal; show content.\n- delta29: delta29: For multi-step chains with ambiguous intermediate results, extract any entity names (person, company, drug) from fetched snippets and immediately retry downstream steps with those anchors. Never abandon chain without ≥2 entity-name refinement attempts.\n- delta3: delta3: When questions specify index membership (S&P 500, NASDAQ, etc.), verify the company's listing status in search results before proceeding with downstream lookups. Disambiguate between similar rankings (e.g., Fortune 100 Fastest-Growing vs. S&P 500 highest growth).\n- delta30: delta30: For brand-ownership chains (brand→parent→shareholder→CEO), extract intermediate entities from each result.

Never refusal without demonstrating result inspection and ≥2 refinement attempts.\n- delta37: After executing search queries, always display returned snippets verbatim before proceeding. Extract intermediate entity names (company, person, CEO). Never claim 'search unavailable' without showing inspection and ≥2 entity-name refinement attempts per step.\n- delta38: For 2024+ queries, trust fetched results over cutoff. Inspect snippets first; extract entity names (event, city, organizer) and retry ≥2x before refusal. Never default to technical-failure claims without showing inspection.\n- delta39: delta39: For multi-step chains, never claim 'technical difficulties' or 'search unavailable' after executing tool calls.

Extract manufacturer/model names (e.g., 'Bugatti', 'Rolls-Royce') and retry CEO searches with those anchors before claiming technical failure. Never refusal without ≥2 entity-name refinement attempts.\n- delta42: delta42: For multi-step chains, distinguish 'search returned no results' from 'search results don't contain private data.' Always inspect snippets first. If intermediate facts (university, president name) are found, retry downstream searches with those anchors before concluding data is private/unavailable.\n- delta43: delta43: Never claim 'technical issues' after executing searches if query contains candidate names (e.g., 'Pogačar Jonas Vingegaard'). Inspect snippets first; extract winner name and retry with '[name] birthplace/birth country' before refusal.\n- delta44: delta44: Never claim 'search unavailable' or 'function unavailable' after executing search_engine_query calls. Always inspect returned snippets first; if empty, show that explicitly. False unavailability claims after tool execution violate transparency.\n- delta45: delta45: For multi-step chains (billionaire→country→election→party→president), never claim 'technical limitations' after executing searches. Inspect all result snippets, extract entity names (person, country, party), and retry downstream steps with those anchors ≥2x before refusal.\n- delta46: delta46: For multi-step chains (award→winner→birthplace→landmark), after executing searches, always inspect snippets first.

Flag temporal inconsistencies or conflicting sources.\\n- delta10: delta10: For date answers, output YYYYMMDD format (no hyphens) unless explicitly instructed otherwise; evaluation frameworks may normalize dates by removing delimiters.\\n- delta11: For ambiguous entity references ('the representative', 'the candidate'), enumerate all plausible matches before selecting one. Cross-verify against authoritative sources (official databases, government records) before finalizing.\\n- delta12: For complex nested queries, split into sequential focused searches. Execute all steps to completion; persist through partial results and retry with refined keywords before concluding inability to answer.\\n- delta13: delta13: For time-period-specific queries (Q1-Q3, first half, etc.), verify the exact period in fetched sources before inferring from full-year data. Don't assume annual leadership implies quarterly leadership.\\n- delta14: delta14: When fetched sources directly answer the query (e.g., 'Samsung led Q1-Q3 2024'), extract and trust that content over inferences. Flag if you pivot away from a fetched answer without explicit contradiction.\\n- delta15: For multi-step chains, verify each intermediate fact (identity, tenure, location, birthplace) against ≥2 independent sources before proceeding. Truncated fetches require explicit re-fetch or secondary source confirmation.\\n- delta16: delta16: For geographic/positional endpoints (mayors, officials), verify exact name format and current tenure against official government websites or databases, not just news sources.

Since joining in 2022, he\\u2019s covered industry news, EV technology, and tuner culture, combining research and insight with a focus on overlooked and distinctive vehicles from every era.\\nSign in to your\\nCarBuzz\\naccount\\nfollow\\nFollow\\nfollowed\\nFollowed\\nLike\\nLike\\nThread\\nLog in\\nHere is a fact-based summary of the story contents:\\nTry something different:\\nShow me the facts\\nExplain it like I\\u2019m 5\\nGive me a lighthearted recap\\n2024 has been a big year for enthusiasts, as many of the world's most renowned supercar and hypercar makers have released new, breathtaking models. For some, like Bentley and Aston Martin, these are extravagant low-volume cars that build on previous high-quality engineering, but others, like McLaren and Ferrari, announced new halo models that are set to redefine performance for the modern age.\\nAs one would expect, vehicles such as this don't come cheap. These are the best models from the most coveted automakers on the planet and, as such, they cost more money than most can even imagine. While there's been no shortage of reveals this year, we wanted to take a look at the 10 most expensive vehicles revealed this year. All of them cost upwards of $2 million, but the most expensive vehicle on the list claims the crown by a mile.\\nWe aimed to only include vehicles on this list with a production run, no one-offs (except for one notable exception), and only one model per manufacturer. They've been ordered from least to most expensive, and we've only included models with confirmed or approximate pricing.\\n10\\nMcLaren W1\\n$2,100,000\\nFeature\\nDetails\\nPowertrain\\n4.0-liter Twin-Turbo V8 Hybrid\\nHorsepower\\n1,258 hp\\nTorque\\n988 lb-ft\\nTop Speed\\n217 mph\\n0-60 mph\\n2.7 seconds\\nProduction Units\\nLimited to 399 units\\nIt's been a long time since production of the P1 ended, and McLaren has finally remedied this halo-car dry spell with its successor: the W1. The name comes from the brand's \\\"World Championship\\\" mindset and is a tribute to the company's first Driver's and Constructor's World Championships in 1974, the latter of which the brand nabbed once again in 2024.\\nGoogle News\\nFollow On\\nGoogle News\\nAdd CarBuzz to your Google News feed.\\nExpand\\nCollapse\\nObviously, there's a lot of weight to this name, but the car lives up to it thanks to\\nsome truly impressive performance specs\\n. A twin-turbo V8 hybrid powertrain boasts over 1,200 horsepower, making it the most powerful road-legal McLaren ever made. It combines that performance with a McLaren Aerocell monocoque and F1-derived suspension, allowing for a dry weight of a mere 3,084 lbs. The top speed is 217, and the car looks like a gorgeous evolution of the brand's famous design language. It's everything we wanted out of the next-gen McLaren hypercar,\\n9\\nBertone GB110\\n$2,100,000\\nFeature\\nDetails\\nEngine\\nV8\\nHorsepower\\n1,108 hp\\nTorque\\n811 lb-ft\\nTop Speed\\n217 mph\\n0-186 mph\\n12.9 seconds\\nProduction Units\\nLimited to 33\\nIn a long-awaited return of the legendary design house, Bertone has unveiled the GB100: a wedge masterpiece that will become\\nthe design house's first hypercar\\n. Powered by a twin-turbo 5.2-liter V10 engine, it will produce over 1,100 horsepower and rocket to 217 mph, according to the design studio. The company isn't worried about 0-60 mph times, instead going much bigger, and saying it'll shoot from 0-186 mph in just 12.9 seconds.\\nThe design is incredible, a mix\\nbetween the 1950s and the 1970s\\n, and pays homage to recent supercars from Lamborghini and McLaren. The company even says it will be the first hypercar to run off fuel made of plastic waste, but we'll have to see if that happens when the first of the 33-car production run makes it into customer's hands.\\n8\\nBentley Batur Convertible\\n~$2,300,000\\nFeature\\nDetails\\nEngine\\nTwin-Turbo W12\\nHorsepower\\n739 hp\\nTorque\\n737 lb-ft\\nTop Speed\\n209 mph\\n0-60 mph\\n3.3 seconds\\nProduction Units\\nLimited to 16\\nIt still hurts to think that Bentley's incredible W12 has finally been laid to rest. As one of the most incredible powerplants on sale for the past two decades, this unique configuration could be found under the hood of nearly every Bentley, and the Bentley Batur Convertible is its sendoff. As the name suggests, it's the convertible version of the\\nBatur\\nCoupe that was unveiled in 2022, and it's every bit as\\nbeautiful with the top up or down\\n.\\nRelated\\nHow Bentley's Outgoing W12 Compares With Its New Plug-In Hybrid V8 Engine\\nWith the production of the W12 engine over, how does the twelve-cylinder icon compare to its PHEV V* replacement?\\nPosts\\n1\\nBy\\nRyan De Villiers\\nAug 2, 2024\\nIt features the most powerful version of the W12 ever made thanks to things like upgraded turbochargers and intercoolers, and here it produces a healthy 739 horsepower, allowing it to rocket to 209 mph. Of course, very few will likely get their cars up to this speed, as they'll much rather enjoy the bespoke comfort and attention they'll get driving slowly through the crowds at places like Pebble Beach or Monaco instead.\\n7\\nAston Martin Valiant\\n$2,500,000\\nFeature\\nDetails\\nEngine\\nTwin-Turbo V12\\nHorsepower\\n734 hp\\nTorque\\n555 lb-ft\\nTop Speed\\nUnknown\\n0-60 mph\\nUnknown\\nProduction Units\\nLimited to 38\\nAston Martin has been enjoying releasing highly limited runs of supercars over the last few years, all building off of one another. The newest entrant to this list is the\\nValiant\\n, which is an evolution of the\\nValour\\nbased on a bespoke commission created by F1 World Champion Fernando Alonso. It looks properly mean, with an exaggerated body kit and massive wing that make it look ready for takeoff.\\nOf course, another iteration of the brand's incredible V12 is under the hood, and here it's mated to a six-speed manual transmission with some of the most beautiful exposed linkages. The brand hasn't announced any performance numbers, so we have no idea how quickly it will rocket around a racetrack, but it will likely only see use in such a fashion very rarely,\\ngiven that only 38 will be produced\\nfor the exorbitant price of $2.5 million.\\n6\\nHennessey Venom F5-M Roadster\\n$2,650,000\\nFeature\\nDetails\\nEngine\\nTwin-Turbo V8\\nHorsepower\\n1,817 hp\\nTorque\\n1,193 lb-ft\\nTop Speed\\nUnknown\\n0-60 mph\\nUnknown\\nProduction Units\\nLimited to 12\\nHennessey Performance always puts 110% into its models, which is why we're not surprised it's unveiled a\\nmanual version of its incredible F5 Roadster\\n. The F5 is the first hypercar the brand has made fully in-house. There is no Lotus chassis used here, and it's an unbelievable first attempt as it boasts over 1,800 horsepower courtesy of the most American of powertrains: a Twin-turbo V8.\\nRelated\\nMost Powerful Rear-Wheel Drive Car Ever With A Manual Transmission\\nSome of the most powerful cars ever made feature rapid-fire semi-automatic gearboxes, so this is the most powerful equipped with a manual unit.\\nPosts\\nBy\\nKyle Francis\\nDec 6, 2024\\nOf course, handling power like this is usually left to the likes of some robust and advanced automatic transmission, but the company was determined to get a manual involved. This meant reaching out to Costruzione Italiana Macchine Attrezzi (CIMA) for their expertise in such matters, a company that has extensive experience in such matters, given it's also created a manual for the upcoming NILU hypercar. We can only imagine what a car like this would be to drive, and given only 12 will be made, we guess we're stuck dreaming.\\n5\\nF80\\n$3,100,000\\nFeature\\nDetails\\nPowertrain\\nTwin-Turbo V6 Hybrid\\nHorsepower\\n1,184 hp\\nTorque\\n627 lb-ft (engine only)\\nTop Speed\\n217 mph\\n0-62 mph\\n2.15 seconds\\nProduction Units\\nLimited to 799\\nThe enigmatic La Ferrari successor has finally been\\nrevealed to the world as the F80 hypercar\\nready to help bring the Prancing Horse into the future. The speculation about this car has been never-ending since the first production mules were seen years ago. Having to stand on the shoulders of such a revered predecessor is no easy task, but if there's one company capable of doing it, it's Ferrari.\\nRelated\\nWATCH: Ferrari F80's V6 Sounds Like Disappointment, Makes Us Long For A V12\\nFerrari has many reasons for downsizing from a V12, but we have one reason why it was a bad idea: the sound.\\nPosts\\nBy\\nJacob Oliva\\nOct 22, 2024\\nThe result certainly has the looks of a next-gen hypercar, invoking a boxier image and a distinct nose like the one on the\\n12Cilindri\\nthat gives it the impression of sucking to the ground. A 0-60 mph time of 2.15 seconds is also impressive, as is the 217 mph top speed, but there's no denying the V6 powertrain lacks the visceral nature of the previously used V12, and we're hoping the driving experience makes up for it.\\n4\\nPagani Utopia Roadster\\n$3,300,000\\nFeature\\nDetails\\nEngine\\nTwin-Turbo V12\\nHorsepower\\n851 hp\\nTorque\\n811 lb-ft\\nTop Speed\\nUnknown\\n0-60 mph\\nUnknown\\nProduction Units\\nLimited to 130\\nEvery vehicle Pagani Automobili creates is a work of art, as it's a company in the business of creating art as much as it's in the business of creating supercars, but the\\nnew Utopia Roadster is no exception\\n. First, it weighs a mere 2,822 lbs - the same as the coupe - thanks to extensive weight-saving techniques. If you want cover, you'll either have to choose between a removable hardtop, or a soft top found in a suitcase in the middle of the car for emergencies.\\nIt features the same twin-turbo V12 as the regular\\nUtopia\\n, and its performance is the same as it produces a blistering 851 horses, but any mention of top speed or 0-60 mph times would be uncharacteristic of the company. At the very least, you can choose a manual or automatic transmission, and any number of other features with a starting price of $3.3 million.\\n3\\nPininfarina Battista and Barchetta \\\"Bruce Wayne\\\"\\n$4,200,000\\nFeature\\nDetails\\nPowertrain\\nQuad Electric Motors\\nHorsepower\\n1,877 hp\\nTorque\\n1,726 lb-ft\\nTop Speed\\n222 mph\\n0-60 mph\\n1.79 seconds\\nProduction Units\\nLimited to 4\\nThis is one of\\nthe most unique reveals of the year\\n, and it's all thanks to Batman. Warner Brothers has had the grand idea of turning Batman's fictional alter-ego, Billionaire Bruce Wayne, into the inspiration for real-life items and experiences, and it's teamed up with Pininfarina to create 4 bespoke vehicles in honor of him. They're based on the B95 hyper Barchetta and the\\nBattista\\nhyper GT, with all the incredible performance they pack.\\nThere is a coupe and convertible version of each, starting with the 'Gotham' variant, which is meant to represent the sophistication of the civilian \\\"Bruce Wayne\\\". The other two are the \\\"Dark Knight\\\" versions, which are meant to represent the dark, brooding nature of Batman himself. All four models are incredibly unique and incredibly expensive, and we look forward to seeing similar vehicles in the future.\\n2\\nBugatti Tourbillon\\n$4,600,000\\nFeature\\nDetails\\nEngine\\nV16 Hybrid\\nHorsepower\\n1,775 hp\\nTorque\\n664 lb-ft (engine torque)\\nTop Speed\\n276 mph\\n0-62 mph\\n2.0 seconds\\nProduction Units\\nLimited to 250\\nThe\\nTourbillon\\nis the next masterpiece from Bugatti, and it's the result of the profound electrification expertise owner Rimac was able to impart to the French brand. Rather than going full EV with the next-generation hypercar, the company decided that glorious combustion was an inseparable part of Bugatti's identity, and thus coupled electric motors with an all-new V16 engine - the first production V16 in 80 years.\\nRelated\\nThe Bugatti Tourbillon's V16 Sounds Spectacular\\nThis is the first time the Tourbillon's V16 has been heard from outside, unfiltered.\\nPosts\\n3\\nBy\\nSebastian Cenizo\\nNov 25, 2024\\nAside from that, the car is leaner and meaner than the Chiron that preceded it, but Bugatti is adamant that it's even more livable, and even usable as a daily driver if you're crazy enough. While we couldn't even dream of spending $4.6 million on a vehicle of any kind, sitting in the driver's seat of the new Tourbillon and\\nstaring at its mesmerizing gauge cluster\\nmay just be worth the price of entry.\\n1\\nRolls-Royce Arcadia Droptail\\n~$31 Million\\nFeature\\nDetails\\nEngine\\nTwin-Turbo V12\\nHorsepower\\n593 hp\\nTorque\\n620 lb-ft\\nTop Speed\\nUnknown\\n0-60 mph\\nUnknown\\nProduction Units\\nLimited to 1\\nAnd the most expensive new car for 2024 is\\nthe Rolls-Royce Arcadia Droptail\\n, and it isn't even close. Look, we know we said no one-offs, but how can you not include a $31 million vehicle? Before Rolls-Royce embarked on the Droptail journey there wasn't anything even remotely this expensive for sale.\\nIt's bathed in a \\\"timeless white\\\" color that is meant to look solid most of the time and complex under the lights thanks to aluminum and glass particles in the paint. 8,000 hours of woodwork make up the interior, and the clock face is the most complex ever fit to a Rolls-Royce. The watch face took two years alone to develop and five months to fit in place. Along with the innumerable other pieces of the car that were perfected and hand-placed, the unbelievable price tag is a little more understandable.

Flag temporal inconsistencies or conflicting sources.\\n- delta10: delta10: For date answers, output YYYYMMDD format (no hyphens) unless explicitly instructed otherwise; evaluation frameworks may normalize dates by removing delimiters.\\n- delta11: For ambiguous entity references ('the representative', 'the candidate'), enumerate all plausible matches before selecting one. Cross-verify against authoritative sources (official databases, government records) before finalizing.\\n- delta12: For complex nested queries, split into sequential focused searches. Execute all steps to completion; persist through partial results and retry with refined keywords before concluding inability to answer.\\n- delta13: delta13: For time-period-specific queries (Q1-Q3, first half, etc.), verify the exact period in fetched sources before inferring from full-year data. Don't assume annual leadership implies quarterly leadership.\\n- delta14: delta14: When fetched sources directly answer the query (e.g., 'Samsung led Q1-Q3 2024'), extract and trust that content over inferences. Flag if you pivot away from a fetched answer without explicit contradiction.\\n- delta15: For multi-step chains, verify each intermediate fact (identity, tenure, location, birthplace) against ≥2 independent sources before proceeding. Truncated fetches require explicit re-fetch or secondary source confirmation.\\n- delta16: delta16: For geographic/positional endpoints (mayors, officials), verify exact name format and current tenure against official government websites or databases, not just news sources. Flag if sources conflict on identity.\\n- delta17: delta17: For biographical data (birthplace, origin) from truncated fetches, re-fetch with expanded mode or search secondary authoritative sources (official bios, government records) before inferring downstream facts.\\n- delta18: For multi-step chains, inspect and extract data from each fetched result before concluding.

Synthesize partial data across all fetches.\\n- delta21: delta21: For multi-step chains (employer→city→landmark→founder), execute each step with entity-name searches before moving forward. Empty results on step N do not justify refusal; retry step N then proceed to N+1 with available data.\\n- delta22: delta22: For multi-step chains, if you possess partial knowledge (e.g., CFO name), use it as a search refinement anchor. Retry with entity names before concluding inability.

Since joining in 2022, he\\\\u2019s covered industry news, EV technology, and tuner culture, combining research and insight with a focus on overlooked and distinctive vehicles from every era.\\\\nSign in to your\\\\nCarBuzz\\\\naccount\\\\nfollow\\\\nFollow\\\\nfollowed\\\\nFollowed\\\\nLike\\\\nLike\\\\nThread\\\\nLog in\\\\nHere is a fact-based summary of the story contents:\\\\nTry something different:\\\\nShow me the facts\\\\nExplain it like I\\\\u2019m 5\\\\nGive me a lighthearted recap\\\\n2024 has been a big year for enthusiasts, as many of the world\\'s most renowned supercar and hypercar makers have released new, breathtaking models. For some, like Bentley and Aston Martin, these are extravagant low-volume cars that build on previous high-quality engineering, but others, like McLaren and Ferrari, announced new halo models that are set to redefine performance for the modern age.\\\\nAs one would expect, vehicles such as this don\\'t come cheap. These are the best models from the most coveted automakers on the planet and, as such, they cost more money than most can even imagine. While there\\'s been no shortage of reveals this year, we wanted to take a look at the 10 most expensive vehicles revealed this year. All of them cost upwards of $2 million, but the most expensive vehicle on the list claims the crown by a mile.\\\\nWe aimed to only include vehicles on this list with a production run, no one-offs (except for one notable exception), and only one model per manufacturer. They\\'ve been ordered from least to most expensive, and we\\'ve only included models with confirmed or approximate pricing.\\\\n10\\\\nMcLaren W1\\\\n$2,100,000\\\\nFeature\\\\nDetails\\\\nPowertrain\\\\n4.0-liter Twin-Turbo V8 Hybrid\\\\nHorsepower\\\\n1,258 hp\\\\nTorque\\\\n988 lb-ft\\\\nTop Speed\\\\n217 mph\\\\n0-60 mph\\\\n2.7 seconds\\\\nProduction Units\\\\nLimited to 399 units\\\\nIt\\'s been a long time since production of the P1 ended, and McLaren has finally remedied this halo-car dry spell with its successor: the W1. The name comes from the brand\\'s \\\\\"World Championship\\\\\" mindset and is a tribute to the company\\'s first Driver\\'s and Constructor\\'s World Championships in 1974, the latter of which the brand nabbed once again in 2024.\\\\nGoogle News\\\\nFollow On\\\\nGoogle News\\\\nAdd CarBuzz to your Google News feed.\\\\nExpand\\\\nCollapse\\\\nObviously, there\\'s a lot of weight to this name, but the car lives up to it thanks to\\\\nsome truly impressive performance specs\\\\n. A twin-turbo V8 hybrid powertrain boasts over 1,200 horsepower, making it the most powerful road-legal McLaren ever made. It combines that performance with a McLaren Aerocell monocoque and F1-derived suspension, allowing for a dry weight of a mere 3,084 lbs. The top speed is 217, and the car looks like a gorgeous evolution of the brand\\'s famous design language. It\\'s everything we wanted out of the next-gen McLaren hypercar,\\\\n9\\\\nBertone GB110\\\\n$2,100,000\\\\nFeature\\\\nDetails\\\\nEngine\\\\nV8\\\\nHorsepower\\\\n1,108 hp\\\\nTorque\\\\n811 lb-ft\\\\nTop Speed\\\\n217 mph\\\\n0-186 mph\\\\n12.9 seconds\\\\nProduction Units\\\\nLimited to 33\\\\nIn a long-awaited return of the legendary design house, Bertone has unveiled the GB100: a wedge masterpiece that will become\\\\nthe design house\\'s first hypercar\\\\n. Powered by a twin-turbo 5.2-liter V10 engine, it will produce over 1,100 horsepower and rocket to 217 mph, according to the design studio. The company isn\\'t worried about 0-60 mph times, instead going much bigger, and saying it\\'ll shoot from 0-186 mph in just 12.9 seconds.\\\\nThe design is incredible, a mix\\\\nbetween the 1950s and the 1970s\\\\n, and pays homage to recent supercars from Lamborghini and McLaren. The company even says it will be the first hypercar to run off fuel made of plastic waste, but we\\'ll have to see if that happens when the first of the 33-car production run makes it into customer\\'s hands.\\\\n8\\\\nBentley Batur Convertible\\\\n~$2,300,000\\\\nFeature\\\\nDetails\\\\nEngine\\\\nTwin-Turbo W12\\\\nHorsepower\\\\n739 hp\\\\nTorque\\\\n737 lb-ft\\\\nTop Speed\\\\n209 mph\\\\n0-60 mph\\\\n3.3 seconds\\\\nProduction Units\\\\nLimited to 16\\\\nIt still hurts to think that Bentley\\'s incredible W12 has finally been laid to rest. As one of the most incredible powerplants on sale for the past two decades, this unique configuration could be found under the hood of nearly every Bentley, and the Bentley Batur Convertible is its sendoff. As the name suggests, it\\'s the convertible version of the\\\\nBatur\\\\nCoupe that was unveiled in 2022, and it\\'s every bit as\\\\nbeautiful with the top up or down\\\\n.\\\\nRelated\\\\nHow Bentley\\'s Outgoing W12 Compares With Its New Plug-In Hybrid V8 Engine\\\\nWith the production of the W12 engine over, how does the twelve-cylinder icon compare to its PHEV V* replacement?\\\\nPosts\\\\n1\\\\nBy\\\\nRyan De Villiers\\\\nAug 2, 2024\\\\nIt features the most powerful version of the W12 ever made thanks to things like upgraded turbochargers and intercoolers, and here it produces a healthy 739 horsepower, allowing it to rocket to 209 mph. Of course, very few will likely get their cars up to this speed, as they\\'ll much rather enjoy the bespoke comfort and attention they\\'ll get driving slowly through the crowds at places like Pebble Beach or Monaco instead.\\\\n7\\\\nAston Martin Valiant\\\\n$2,500,000\\\\nFeature\\\\nDetails\\\\nEngine\\\\nTwin-Turbo V12\\\\nHorsepower\\\\n734 hp\\\\nTorque\\\\n555 lb-ft\\\\nTop Speed\\\\nUnknown\\\\n0-60 mph\\\\nUnknown\\\\nProduction Units\\\\nLimited to 38\\\\nAston Martin has been enjoying releasing highly limited runs of supercars over the last few years, all building off of one another. The newest entrant to this list is the\\\\nValiant\\\\n, which is an evolution of the\\\\nValour\\\\nbased on a bespoke commission created by F1 World Champion Fernando Alonso. It looks properly mean, with an exaggerated body kit and massive wing that make it look ready for takeoff.\\\\nOf course, another iteration of the brand\\'s incredible V12 is under the hood, and here it\\'s mated to a six-speed manual transmission with some of the most beautiful exposed linkages. The brand hasn\\'t announced any performance numbers, so we have no idea how quickly it will rocket around a racetrack, but it will likely only see use in such a fashion very rarely,\\\\ngiven that only 38 will be produced\\\\nfor the exorbitant price of $2.5 million.\\\\n6\\\\nHennessey Venom F5-M Roadster\\\\n$2,650,000\\\\nFeature\\\\nDetails\\\\nEngine\\\\nTwin-Turbo V8\\\\nHorsepower\\\\n1,817 hp\\\\nTorque\\\\n1,193 lb-ft\\\\nTop Speed\\\\nUnknown\\\\n0-60 mph\\\\nUnknown\\\\nProduction Units\\\\nLimited to 12\\\\nHennessey Performance always puts 110% into its models, which is why we\\'re not surprised it\\'s unveiled a\\\\nmanual version of its incredible F5 Roadster\\\\n. The F5 is the first hypercar the brand has made fully in-house. There is no Lotus chassis used here, and it\\'s an unbelievable first attempt as it boasts over 1,800 horsepower courtesy of the most American of powertrains: a Twin-turbo V8.\\\\nRelated\\\\nMost Powerful Rear-Wheel Drive Car Ever With A Manual Transmission\\\\nSome of the most powerful cars ever made feature rapid-fire semi-automatic gearboxes, so this is the most powerful equipped with a manual unit.\\\\nPosts\\\\nBy\\\\nKyle Francis\\\\nDec 6, 2024\\\\nOf course, handling power like this is usually left to the likes of some robust and advanced automatic transmission, but the company was determined to get a manual involved. This meant reaching out to Costruzione Italiana Macchine Attrezzi (CIMA) for their expertise in such matters, a company that has extensive experience in such matters, given it\\'s also created a manual for the upcoming NILU hypercar. We can only imagine what a car like this would be to drive, and given only 12 will be made, we guess we\\'re stuck dreaming.\\\\n5\\\\nF80\\\\n$3,100,000\\\\nFeature\\\\nDetails\\\\nPowertrain\\\\nTwin-Turbo V6 Hybrid\\\\nHorsepower\\\\n1,184 hp\\\\nTorque\\\\n627 lb-ft (engine only)\\\\nTop Speed\\\\n217 mph\\\\n0-62 mph\\\\n2.15 seconds\\\\nProduction Units\\\\nLimited to 799\\\\nThe enigmatic La Ferrari successor has finally been\\\\nrevealed to the world as the F80 hypercar\\\\nready to help bring the Prancing Horse into the future. The speculation about this car has been never-ending since the first production mules were seen years ago. Having to stand on the shoulders of such a revered predecessor is no easy task, but if there\\'s one company capable of doing it, it\\'s Ferrari.\\\\nRelated\\\\nWATCH: Ferrari F80\\'s V6 Sounds Like Disappointment, Makes Us Long For A V12\\\\nFerrari has many reasons for downsizing from a V12, but we have one reason why it was a bad idea: the sound.\\\\nPosts\\\\nBy\\\\nJacob Oliva\\\\nOct 22, 2024\\\\nThe result certainly has the looks of a next-gen hypercar, invoking a boxier image and a distinct nose like the one on the\\\\n12Cilindri\\\\nthat gives it the impression of sucking to the ground. A 0-60 mph time of 2.15 seconds is also impressive, as is the 217 mph top speed, but there\\'s no denying the V6 powertrain lacks the visceral nature of the previously used V12, and we\\'re hoping the driving experience makes up for it.\\\\n4\\\\nPagani Utopia Roadster\\\\n$3,300,000\\\\nFeature\\\\nDetails\\\\nEngine\\\\nTwin-Turbo V12\\\\nHorsepower\\\\n851 hp\\\\nTorque\\\\n811 lb-ft\\\\nTop Speed\\\\nUnknown\\\\n0-60 mph\\\\nUnknown\\\\nProduction Units\\\\nLimited to 130\\\\nEvery vehicle Pagani Automobili creates is a work of art, as it\\'s a company in the business of creating art as much as it\\'s in the business of creating supercars, but the\\\\nnew Utopia Roadster is no exception\\\\n. First, it weighs a mere 2,822 lbs - the same as the coupe - thanks to extensive weight-saving techniques. If you want cover, you\\'ll either have to choose between a removable hardtop, or a soft top found in a suitcase in the middle of the car for emergencies.\\\\nIt features the same twin-turbo V12 as the regular\\\\nUtopia\\\\n, and its performance is the same as it produces a blistering 851 horses, but any mention of top speed or 0-60 mph times would be uncharacteristic of the company. At the very least, you can choose a manual or automatic transmission, and any number of other features with a starting price of $3.3 million.\\\\n3\\\\nPininfarina Battista and Barchetta \\\\\"Bruce Wayne\\\\\"\\\\n$4,200,000\\\\nFeature\\\\nDetails\\\\nPowertrain\\\\nQuad Electric Motors\\\\nHorsepower\\\\n1,877 hp\\\\nTorque\\\\n1,726 lb-ft\\\\nTop Speed\\\\n222 mph\\\\n0-60 mph\\\\n1.79 seconds\\\\nProduction Units\\\\nLimited to 4\\\\nThis is one of\\\\nthe most unique reveals of the year\\\\n, and it\\'s all thanks to Batman. Warner Brothers has had the grand idea of turning Batman\\'s fictional alter-ego, Billionaire Bruce Wayne, into the inspiration for real-life items and experiences, and it\\'s teamed up with Pininfarina to create 4 bespoke vehicles in honor of him. They\\'re based on the B95 hyper Barchetta and the\\\\nBattista\\\\nhyper GT, with all the incredible performance they pack.\\\\nThere is a coupe and convertible version of each, starting with the \\'Gotham\\' variant, which is meant to represent the sophistication of the civilian \\\\\"Bruce Wayne\\\\\". The other two are the \\\\\"Dark Knight\\\\\" versions, which are meant to represent the dark, brooding nature of Batman himself. All four models are incredibly unique and incredibly expensive, and we look forward to seeing similar vehicles in the future.\\\\n2\\\\nBugatti Tourbillon\\\\n$4,600,000\\\\nFeature\\\\nDetails\\\\nEngine\\\\nV16 Hybrid\\\\nHorsepower\\\\n1,775 hp\\\\nTorque\\\\n664 lb-ft (engine torque)\\\\nTop Speed\\\\n276 mph\\\\n0-62 mph\\\\n2.0 seconds\\\\nProduction Units\\\\nLimited to 250\\\\nThe\\\\nTourbillon\\\\nis the next masterpiece from Bugatti, and it\\'s the result of the profound electrification expertise owner Rimac was able to impart to the French brand. Rather than going full EV with the next-generation hypercar, the company decided that glorious combustion was an inseparable part of Bugatti\\'s identity, and thus coupled electric motors with an all-new V16 engine - the first production V16 in 80 years.\\\\nRelated\\\\nThe Bugatti Tourbillon\\'s V16 Sounds Spectacular\\\\nThis is the first time the Tourbillon\\'s V16 has been heard from outside, unfiltered.\\\\nPosts\\\\n3\\\\nBy\\\\nSebastian Cenizo\\\\nNov 25, 2024\\\\nAside from that, the car is leaner and meaner than the Chiron that preceded it, but Bugatti is adamant that it\\'s even more livable, and even usable as a daily driver if you\\'re crazy enough. While we couldn\\'t even dream of spending $4.6 million on a vehicle of any kind, sitting in the driver\\'s seat of the new Tourbillon and\\\\nstaring at its mesmerizing gauge cluster\\\\nmay just be worth the price of entry.\\\\n1\\\\nRolls-Royce Arcadia Droptail\\\\n~$31 Million\\\\nFeature\\\\nDetails\\\\nEngine\\\\nTwin-Turbo V12\\\\nHorsepower\\\\n593 hp\\\\nTorque\\\\n620 lb-ft\\\\nTop Speed\\\\nUnknown\\\\n0-60 mph\\\\nUnknown\\\\nProduction Units\\\\nLimited to 1\\\\nAnd the most expensive new car for 2024 is\\\\nthe Rolls-Royce Arcadia Droptail\\\\n, and it isn\\'t even close. Look, we know we said no one-offs, but how can you not include a $31 million vehicle? Before Rolls-Royce embarked on the Droptail journey there wasn\\'t anything even remotely this expensive for sale.\\\\nIt\\'s bathed in a \\\\\"timeless white\\\\\" color that is meant to look solid most of the time and complex under the lights thanks to aluminum and glass particles in the paint. 8,000 hours of woodwork make up the interior, and the clock face is the most complex ever fit to a Rolls-Royce. The watch face took two years alone to develop and five months to fit in place. Along with the innumerable other pieces of the car that were perfected and hand-placed, the unbelievable price tag is a little more understandable.

Flag temporal inconsistencies or conflicting sources.\\n- delta10: delta10: For date answers, output YYYYMMDD format (no hyphens) unless explicitly instructed otherwise; evaluation frameworks may normalize dates by removing delimiters.\\n- delta11: For ambiguous entity references ('the representative', 'the candidate'), enumerate all plausible matches before selecting one. Cross-verify against authoritative sources (official databases, government records) before finalizing.\\n- delta12: For complex nested queries, split into sequential focused searches. Execute all steps to completion; persist through partial results and retry with refined keywords before concluding inability to answer.\\n- delta13: delta13: For time-period-specific queries (Q1-Q3, first half, etc.), verify the exact period in fetched sources before inferring from full-year data. Don't assume annual leadership implies quarterly leadership.\\n- delta14: delta14: When fetched sources directly answer the query (e.g., 'Samsung led Q1-Q3 2024'), extract and trust that content over inferences. Flag if you pivot away from a fetched answer without explicit contradiction.\\n- delta15: For multi-step chains, verify each intermediate fact (identity, tenure, location, birthplace) against ≥2 independent sources before proceeding. Truncated fetches require explicit re-fetch or secondary source confirmation.\\n- delta16: delta16: For geographic/positional endpoints (mayors, officials), verify exact name format and current tenure against official government websites or databases, not just news sources. Flag if sources conflict on identity.\\n- delta17: delta17: For biographical data (birthplace, origin) from truncated fetches, re-fetch with expanded mode or search secondary authoritative sources (official bios, government records) before inferring downstream facts.\\n- delta18: For multi-step chains, inspect and extract data from each fetched result before concluding. Extract entity names (university, person, company) as anchors for downstream searches.

Synthesize partial data across all fetches.\\n- delta21: delta21: For multi-step chains (employer→city→landmark→founder), execute each step with entity-name searches before moving forward. Empty results on step N do not justify refusal; retry step N then proceed to N+1 with available data.\\n- delta22: delta22: For multi-step chains, if you possess partial knowledge (e.g., CFO name), use it as a search refinement anchor.

Since joining in 2022, he\\\\u2019s covered industry news, EV technology, and tuner culture, combining research and insight with a focus on overlooked and distinctive vehicles from every era.\\\\nSign in to your\\\\nCarBuzz\\\\naccount\\\\nfollow\\\\nFollow\\\\nfollowed\\\\nFollowed\\\\nLike\\\\nLike\\\\nThread\\\\nLog in\\\\nHere is a fact-based summary of the story contents:\\\\nTry something different:\\\\nShow me the facts\\\\nExplain it like I\\\\u2019m 5\\\\nGive me a lighthearted recap\\\\n2024 has been a big year for enthusiasts, as many of the world\\'s most renowned supercar and hypercar makers have released new, breathtaking models. For some, like Bentley and Aston Martin, these are extravagant low-volume cars that build on previous high-quality engineering, but others, like McLaren and Ferrari, announced new halo models that are set to redefine performance for the modern age.\\\\nAs one would expect, vehicles such as this don\\'t come cheap. These are the best models from the most coveted automakers on the planet and, as such, they cost more money than most can even imagine. While there\\'s been no shortage of reveals this year, we wanted to take a look at the 10 most expensive vehicles revealed this year. All of them cost upwards of $2 million, but the most expensive vehicle on the list claims the crown by a mile.\\\\nWe aimed to only include vehicles on this list with a production run, no one-offs (except for one notable exception), and only one model per manufacturer. They\\'ve been ordered from least to most expensive, and we\\'ve only included models with confirmed or approximate pricing.\\\\n10\\\\nMcLaren W1\\\\n$2,100,000\\\\nFeature\\\\nDetails\\\\nPowertrain\\\\n4.0-liter Twin-Turbo V8 Hybrid\\\\nHorsepower\\\\n1,258 hp\\\\nTorque\\\\n988 lb-ft\\\\nTop Speed\\\\n217 mph\\\\n0-60 mph\\\\n2.7 seconds\\\\nProduction Units\\\\nLimited to 399 units\\\\nIt\\'s been a long time since production of the P1 ended, and McLaren has finally remedied this halo-car dry spell with its successor: the W1. The name comes from the brand\\'s \\\\\"World Championship\\\\\" mindset and is a tribute to the company\\'s first Driver\\'s and Constructor\\'s World Championships in 1974, the latter of which the brand nabbed once again in 2024.\\\\nGoogle News\\\\nFollow On\\\\nGoogle News\\\\nAdd CarBuzz to your Google News feed.\\\\nExpand\\\\nCollapse\\\\nObviously, there\\'s a lot of weight to this name, but the car lives up to it thanks to\\\\nsome truly impressive performance specs\\\\n. A twin-turbo V8 hybrid powertrain boasts over 1,200 horsepower, making it the most powerful road-legal McLaren ever made. It combines that performance with a McLaren Aerocell monocoque and F1-derived suspension, allowing for a dry weight of a mere 3,084 lbs. The top speed is 217, and the car looks like a gorgeous evolution of the brand\\'s famous design language. It\\'s everything we wanted out of the next-gen McLaren hypercar,\\\\n9\\\\nBertone GB110\\\\n$2,100,000\\\\nFeature\\\\nDetails\\\\nEngine\\\\nV8\\\\nHorsepower\\\\n1,108 hp\\\\nTorque\\\\n811 lb-ft\\\\nTop Speed\\\\n217 mph\\\\n0-186 mph\\\\n12.9 seconds\\\\nProduction Units\\\\nLimited to 33\\\\nIn a long-awaited return of the legendary design house, Bertone has unveiled the GB100: a wedge masterpiece that will become\\\\nthe design house\\'s first hypercar\\\\n. Powered by a twin-turbo 5.2-liter V10 engine, it will produce over 1,100 horsepower and rocket to 217 mph, according to the design studio. The company isn\\'t worried about 0-60 mph times, instead going much bigger, and saying it\\'ll shoot from 0-186 mph in just 12.9 seconds.\\\\nThe design is incredible, a mix\\\\nbetween the 1950s and the 1970s\\\\n, and pays homage to recent supercars from Lamborghini and McLaren. The company even says it will be the first hypercar to run off fuel made of plastic waste, but we\\'ll have to see if that happens when the first of the 33-car production run makes it into customer\\'s hands.\\\\n8\\\\nBentley Batur Convertible\\\\n~$2,300,000\\\\nFeature\\\\nDetails\\\\nEngine\\\\nTwin-Turbo W12\\\\nHorsepower\\\\n739 hp\\\\nTorque\\\\n737 lb-ft\\\\nTop Speed\\\\n209 mph\\\\n0-60 mph\\\\n3.3 seconds\\\\nProduction Units\\\\nLimited to 16\\\\nIt still hurts to think that Bentley\\'s incredible W12 has finally been laid to rest. As one of the most incredible powerplants on sale for the past two decades, this unique configuration could be found under the hood of nearly every Bentley, and the Bentley Batur Convertible is its sendoff. As the name suggests, it\\'s the convertible version of the\\\\nBatur\\\\nCoupe that was unveiled in 2022, and it\\'s every bit as\\\\nbeautiful with the top up or down\\\\n.\\\\nRelated\\\\nHow Bentley\\'s Outgoing W12 Compares With Its New Plug-In Hybrid V8 Engine\\\\nWith the production of the W12 engine over, how does the twelve-cylinder icon compare to its PHEV V* replacement?\\\\nPosts\\\\n1\\\\nBy\\\\nRyan De Villiers\\\\nAug 2, 2024\\\\nIt features the most powerful version of the W12 ever made thanks to things like upgraded turbochargers and intercoolers, and here it produces a healthy 739 horsepower, allowing it to rocket to 209 mph. Of course, very few will likely get their cars up to this speed, as they\\'ll much rather enjoy the bespoke comfort and attention they\\'ll get driving slowly through the crowds at places like Pebble Beach or Monaco instead.\\\\n7\\\\nAston Martin Valiant\\\\n$2,500,000\\\\nFeature\\\\nDetails\\\\nEngine\\\\nTwin-Turbo V12\\\\nHorsepower\\\\n734 hp\\\\nTorque\\\\n555 lb-ft\\\\nTop Speed\\\\nUnknown\\\\n0-60 mph\\\\nUnknown\\\\nProduction Units\\\\nLimited to 38\\\\nAston Martin has been enjoying releasing highly limited runs of supercars over the last few years, all building off of one another. The newest entrant to this list is the\\\\nValiant\\\\n, which is an evolution of the\\\\nValour\\\\nbased on a bespoke commission created by F1 World Champion Fernando Alonso. It looks properly mean, with an exaggerated body kit and massive wing that make it look ready for takeoff.\\\\nOf course, another iteration of the brand\\'s incredible V12 is under the hood, and here it\\'s mated to a six-speed manual transmission with some of the most beautiful exposed linkages. The brand hasn\\'t announced any performance numbers, so we have no idea how quickly it will rocket around a racetrack, but it will likely only see use in such a fashion very rarely,\\\\ngiven that only 38 will be produced\\\\nfor the exorbitant price of $2.5 million.\\\\n6\\\\nHennessey Venom F5-M Roadster\\\\n$2,650,000\\\\nFeature\\\\nDetails\\\\nEngine\\\\nTwin-Turbo V8\\\\nHorsepower\\\\n1,817 hp\\\\nTorque\\\\n1,193 lb-ft\\\\nTop Speed\\\\nUnknown\\\\n0-60 mph\\\\nUnknown\\\\nProduction Units\\\\nLimited to 12\\\\nHennessey Performance always puts 110% into its models, which is why we\\'re not surprised it\\'s unveiled a\\\\nmanual version of its incredible F5 Roadster\\\\n. The F5 is the first hypercar the brand has made fully in-house. There is no Lotus chassis used here, and it\\'s an unbelievable first attempt as it boasts over 1,800 horsepower courtesy of the most American of powertrains: a Twin-turbo V8.\\\\nRelated\\\\nMost Powerful Rear-Wheel Drive Car Ever With A Manual Transmission\\\\nSome of the most powerful cars ever made feature rapid-fire semi-automatic gearboxes, so this is the most powerful equipped with a manual unit.\\\\nPosts\\\\nBy\\\\nKyle Francis\\\\nDec 6, 2024\\\\nOf course, handling power like this is usually left to the likes of some robust and advanced automatic transmission, but the company was determined to get a manual involved. This meant reaching out to Costruzione Italiana Macchine Attrezzi (CIMA) for their expertise in such matters, a company that has extensive experience in such matters, given it\\'s also created a manual for the upcoming NILU hypercar. We can only imagine what a car like this would be to drive, and given only 12 will be made, we guess we\\'re stuck dreaming.\\\\n5\\\\nF80\\\\n$3,100,000\\\\nFeature\\\\nDetails\\\\nPowertrain\\\\nTwin-Turbo V6 Hybrid\\\\nHorsepower\\\\n1,184 hp\\\\nTorque\\\\n627 lb-ft (engine only)\\\\nTop Speed\\\\n217 mph\\\\n0-62 mph\\\\n2.15 seconds\\\\nProduction Units\\\\nLimited to 799\\\\nThe enigmatic La Ferrari successor has finally been\\\\nrevealed to the world as the F80 hypercar\\\\nready to help bring the Prancing Horse into the future. The speculation about this car has been never-ending since the first production mules were seen years ago. Having to stand on the shoulders of such a revered predecessor is no easy task, but if there\\'s one company capable of doing it, it\\'s Ferrari.\\\\nRelated\\\\nWATCH: Ferrari F80\\'s V6 Sounds Like Disappointment, Makes Us Long For A V12\\\\nFerrari has many reasons for downsizing from a V12, but we have one reason why it was a bad idea: the sound.\\\\nPosts\\\\nBy\\\\nJacob Oliva\\\\nOct 22, 2024\\\\nThe result certainly has the looks of a next-gen hypercar, invoking a boxier image and a distinct nose like the one on the\\\\n12Cilindri\\\\nthat gives it the impression of sucking to the ground. A 0-60 mph time of 2.15 seconds is also impressive, as is the 217 mph top speed, but there\\'s no denying the V6 powertrain lacks the visceral nature of the previously used V12, and we\\'re hoping the driving experience makes up for it.\\\\n4\\\\nPagani Utopia Roadster\\\\n$3,300,000\\\\nFeature\\\\nDetails\\\\nEngine\\\\nTwin-Turbo V12\\\\nHorsepower\\\\n851 hp\\\\nTorque\\\\n811 lb-ft\\\\nTop Speed\\\\nUnknown\\\\n0-60 mph\\\\nUnknown\\\\nProduction Units\\\\nLimited to 130\\\\nEvery vehicle Pagani Automobili creates is a work of art, as it\\'s a company in the business of creating art as much as it\\'s in the business of creating supercars, but the\\\\nnew Utopia Roadster is no exception\\\\n. First, it weighs a mere 2,822 lbs - the same as the coupe - thanks to extensive weight-saving techniques. If you want cover, you\\'ll either have to choose between a removable hardtop, or a soft top found in a suitcase in the middle of the car for emergencies.\\\\nIt features the same twin-turbo V12 as the regular\\\\nUtopia\\\\n, and its performance is the same as it produces a blistering 851 horses, but any mention of top speed or 0-60 mph times would be uncharacteristic of the company. At the very least, you can choose a manual or automatic transmission, and any number of other features with a starting price of $3.3 million.\\\\n3\\\\nPininfarina Battista and Barchetta \\\\\"Bruce Wayne\\\\\"\\\\n$4,200,000\\\\nFeature\\\\nDetails\\\\nPowertrain\\\\nQuad Electric Motors\\\\nHorsepower\\\\n1,877 hp\\\\nTorque\\\\n1,726 lb-ft\\\\nTop Speed\\\\n222 mph\\\\n0-60 mph\\\\n1.79 seconds\\\\nProduction Units\\\\nLimited to 4\\\\nThis is one of\\\\nthe most unique reveals of the year\\\\n, and it\\'s all thanks to Batman. Warner Brothers has had the grand idea of turning Batman\\'s fictional alter-ego, Billionaire Bruce Wayne, into the inspiration for real-life items and experiences, and it\\'s teamed up with Pininfarina to create 4 bespoke vehicles in honor of him. They\\'re based on the B95 hyper Barchetta and the\\\\nBattista\\\\nhyper GT, with all the incredible performance they pack.\\\\nThere is a coupe and convertible version of each, starting with the \\'Gotham\\' variant, which is meant to represent the sophistication of the civilian \\\\\"Bruce Wayne\\\\\". The other two are the \\\\\"Dark Knight\\\\\" versions, which are meant to represent the dark, brooding nature of Batman himself. All four models are incredibly unique and incredibly expensive, and we look forward to seeing similar vehicles in the future.\\\\n2\\\\nBugatti Tourbillon\\\\n$4,600,000\\\\nFeature\\\\nDetails\\\\nEngine\\\\nV16 Hybrid\\\\nHorsepower\\\\n1,775 hp\\\\nTorque\\\\n664 lb-ft (engine torque)\\\\nTop Speed\\\\n276 mph\\\\n0-62 mph\\\\n2.0 seconds\\\\nProduction Units\\\\nLimited to 250\\\\nThe\\\\nTourbillon\\\\nis the next masterpiece from Bugatti, and it\\'s the result of the profound electrification expertise owner Rimac was able to impart to the French brand. Rather than going full EV with the next-generation hypercar, the company decided that glorious combustion was an inseparable part of Bugatti\\'s identity, and thus coupled electric motors with an all-new V16 engine - the first production V16 in 80 years.\\\\nRelated\\\\nThe Bugatti Tourbillon\\'s V16 Sounds Spectacular\\\\nThis is the first time the Tourbillon\\'s V16 has been heard from outside, unfiltered.\\\\nPosts\\\\n3\\\\nBy\\\\nSebastian Cenizo\\\\nNov 25, 2024\\\\nAside from that, the car is leaner and meaner than the Chiron that preceded it, but Bugatti is adamant that it\\'s even more livable, and even usable as a daily driver if you\\'re crazy enough. While we couldn\\'t even dream of spending $4.6 million on a vehicle of any kind, sitting in the driver\\'s seat of the new Tourbillon and\\\\nstaring at its mesmerizing gauge cluster\\\\nmay just be worth the price of entry.\\\\n1\\\\nRolls-Royce Arcadia Droptail\\\\n~$31 Million\\\\nFeature\\\\nDetails\\\\nEngine\\\\nTwin-Turbo V12\\\\nHorsepower\\\\n593 hp\\\\nTorque\\\\n620 lb-ft\\\\nTop Speed\\\\nUnknown\\\\n0-60 mph\\\\nUnknown\\\\nProduction Units\\\\nLimited to 1\\\\nAnd the most expensive new car for 2024 is\\\\nthe Rolls-Royce Arcadia Droptail\\\\n, and it isn\\'t even close. Look, we know we said no one-offs, but how can you not include a $31 million vehicle? Before Rolls-Royce embarked on the Droptail journey there wasn\\'t anything even remotely this expensive for sale.\\\\nIt\\'s bathed in a \\\\\"timeless white\\\\\" color that is meant to look solid most of the time and complex under the lights thanks to aluminum and glass particles in the paint. 8,000 hours of woodwork make up the interior, and the clock face is the most complex ever fit to a Rolls-Royce. The watch face took two years alone to develop and five months to fit in place. Along with the innumerable other pieces of the car that were perfected and hand-placed, the unbelievable price tag is a little more understandable.

Flag temporal inconsistencies or conflicting sources.\\n- delta10: delta10: For date answers, output YYYYMMDD format (no hyphens) unless explicitly instructed otherwise; evaluation frameworks may normalize dates by removing delimiters.\\n- delta11: For ambiguous entity references ('the representative', 'the candidate'), enumerate all plausible matches before selecting one. Cross-verify against authoritative sources (official databases, government records) before finalizing.\\n- delta12: For complex nested queries, split into sequential focused searches. Execute all steps to completion; persist through partial results and retry with refined keywords before concluding inability to answer.\\n- delta13: delta13: For time-period-specific queries (Q1-Q3, first half, etc.), verify the exact period in fetched sources before inferring from full-year data. Don't assume annual leadership implies quarterly leadership.\\n- delta14: delta14: When fetched sources directly answer the query (e.g., 'Samsung led Q1-Q3 2024'), extract and trust that content over inferences. Flag if you pivot away from a fetched answer without explicit contradiction.\\n- delta15: For multi-step chains, verify each intermediate fact (identity, tenure, location, birthplace) against ≥2 independent sources before proceeding. Truncated fetches require explicit re-fetch or secondary source confirmation.\\n- delta16: delta16: For geographic/positional endpoints (mayors, officials), verify exact name format and current tenure against official government websites or databases, not just news sources. Flag if sources conflict on identity.\\n- delta17: delta17: For biographical data (birthplace, origin) from truncated fetches, re-fetch with expanded mode or search secondary authoritative sources (official bios, government records) before inferring downstream facts.\\n- delta18: For multi-step chains, inspect and extract data from each fetched result before concluding.

Since joining in 2022, he\\\\u2019s covered industry news, EV technology, and tuner culture, combining research and insight with a focus on overlooked and distinctive vehicles from every era.\\\\nSign in to your\\\\nCarBuzz\\\\naccount\\\\nfollow\\\\nFollow\\\\nfollowed\\\\nFollowed\\\\nLike\\\\nLike\\\\nThread\\\\nLog in\\\\nHere is a fact-based summary of the story contents:\\\\nTry something different:\\\\nShow me the facts\\\\nExplain it like I\\\\u2019m 5\\\\nGive me a lighthearted recap\\\\n2024 has been a big year for enthusiasts, as many of the world\\'s most renowned supercar and hypercar makers have released new, breathtaking models. For some, like Bentley and Aston Martin, these are extravagant low-volume cars that build on previous high-quality engineering, but others, like McLaren and Ferrari, announced new halo models that are set to redefine performance for the modern age.\\\\nAs one would expect, vehicles such as this don\\'t come cheap. These are the best models from the most coveted automakers on the planet and, as such, they cost more money than most can even imagine. While there\\'s been no shortage of reveals this year, we wanted to take a look at the 10 most expensive vehicles revealed this year. All of them cost upwards of $2 million, but the most expensive vehicle on the list claims the crown by a mile.\\\\nWe aimed to only include vehicles on this list with a production run, no one-offs (except for one notable exception), and only one model per manufacturer. They\\'ve been ordered from least to most expensive, and we\\'ve only included models with confirmed or approximate pricing.\\\\n10\\\\nMcLaren W1\\\\n$2,100,000\\\\nFeature\\\\nDetails\\\\nPowertrain\\\\n4.0-liter Twin-Turbo V8 Hybrid\\\\nHorsepower\\\\n1,258 hp\\\\nTorque\\\\n988 lb-ft\\\\nTop Speed\\\\n217 mph\\\\n0-60 mph\\\\n2.7 seconds\\\\nProduction Units\\\\nLimited to 399 units\\\\nIt\\'s been a long time since production of the P1 ended, and McLaren has finally remedied this halo-car dry spell with its successor: the W1. The name comes from the brand\\'s \\\\\"World Championship\\\\\" mindset and is a tribute to the company\\'s first Driver\\'s and Constructor\\'s World Championships in 1974, the latter of which the brand nabbed once again in 2024.\\\\nGoogle News\\\\nFollow On\\\\nGoogle News\\\\nAdd CarBuzz to your Google News feed.\\\\nExpand\\\\nCollapse\\\\nObviously, there\\'s a lot of weight to this name, but the car lives up to it thanks to\\\\nsome truly impressive performance specs\\\\n. A twin-turbo V8 hybrid powertrain boasts over 1,200 horsepower, making it the most powerful road-legal McLaren ever made. It combines that performance with a McLaren Aerocell monocoque and F1-derived suspension, allowing for a dry weight of a mere 3,084 lbs. The top speed is 217, and the car looks like a gorgeous evolution of the brand\\'s famous design language. It\\'s everything we wanted out of the next-gen McLaren hypercar,\\\\n9\\\\nBertone GB110\\\\n$2,100,000\\\\nFeature\\\\nDetails\\\\nEngine\\\\nV8\\\\nHorsepower\\\\n1,108 hp\\\\nTorque\\\\n811 lb-ft\\\\nTop Speed\\\\n217 mph\\\\n0-186 mph\\\\n12.9 seconds\\\\nProduction Units\\\\nLimited to 33\\\\nIn a long-awaited return of the legendary design house, Bertone has unveiled the GB100: a wedge masterpiece that will become\\\\nthe design house\\'s first hypercar\\\\n. Powered by a twin-turbo 5.2-liter V10 engine, it will produce over 1,100 horsepower and rocket to 217 mph, according to the design studio. The company isn\\'t worried about 0-60 mph times, instead going much bigger, and saying it\\'ll shoot from 0-186 mph in just 12.9 seconds.\\\\nThe design is incredible, a mix\\\\nbetween the 1950s and the 1970s\\\\n, and pays homage to recent supercars from Lamborghini and McLaren. The company even says it will be the first hypercar to run off fuel made of plastic waste, but we\\'ll have to see if that happens when the first of the 33-car production run makes it into customer\\'s hands.\\\\n8\\\\nBentley Batur Convertible\\\\n~$2,300,000\\\\nFeature\\\\nDetails\\\\nEngine\\\\nTwin-Turbo W12\\\\nHorsepower\\\\n739 hp\\\\nTorque\\\\n737 lb-ft\\\\nTop Speed\\\\n209 mph\\\\n0-60 mph\\\\n3.3 seconds\\\\nProduction Units\\\\nLimited to 16\\\\nIt still hurts to think that Bentley\\'s incredible W12 has finally been laid to rest. As one of the most incredible powerplants on sale for the past two decades, this unique configuration could be found under the hood of nearly every Bentley, and the Bentley Batur Convertible is its sendoff. As the name suggests, it\\'s the convertible version of the\\\\nBatur\\\\nCoupe that was unveiled in 2022, and it\\'s every bit as\\\\nbeautiful with the top up or down\\\\n.\\\\nRelated\\\\nHow Bentley\\'s Outgoing W12 Compares With Its New Plug-In Hybrid V8 Engine\\\\nWith the production of the W12 engine over, how does the twelve-cylinder icon compare to its PHEV V* replacement?\\\\nPosts\\\\n1\\\\nBy\\\\nRyan De Villiers\\\\nAug 2, 2024\\\\nIt features the most powerful version of the W12 ever made thanks to things like upgraded turbochargers and intercoolers, and here it produces a healthy 739 horsepower, allowing it to rocket to 209 mph. Of course, very few will likely get their cars up to this speed, as they\\'ll much rather enjoy the bespoke comfort and attention they\\'ll get driving slowly through the crowds at places like Pebble Beach or Monaco instead.\\\\n7\\\\nAston Martin Valiant\\\\n$2,500,000\\\\nFeature\\\\nDetails\\\\nEngine\\\\nTwin-Turbo V12\\\\nHorsepower\\\\n734 hp\\\\nTorque\\\\n555 lb-ft\\\\nTop Speed\\\\nUnknown\\\\n0-60 mph\\\\nUnknown\\\\nProduction Units\\\\nLimited to 38\\\\nAston Martin has been enjoying releasing highly limited runs of supercars over the last few years, all building off of one another. The newest entrant to this list is the\\\\nValiant\\\\n, which is an evolution of the\\\\nValour\\\\nbased on a bespoke commission created by F1 World Champion Fernando Alonso. It looks properly mean, with an exaggerated body kit and massive wing that make it look ready for takeoff.\\\\nOf course, another iteration of the brand\\'s incredible V12 is under the hood, and here it\\'s mated to a six-speed manual transmission with some of the most beautiful exposed linkages. The brand hasn\\'t announced any performance numbers, so we have no idea how quickly it will rocket around a racetrack, but it will likely only see use in such a fashion very rarely,\\\\ngiven that only 38 will be produced\\\\nfor the exorbitant price of $2.5 million.\\\\n6\\\\nHennessey Venom F5-M Roadster\\\\n$2,650,000\\\\nFeature\\\\nDetails\\\\nEngine\\\\nTwin-Turbo V8\\\\nHorsepower\\\\n1,817 hp\\\\nTorque\\\\n1,193 lb-ft\\\\nTop Speed\\\\nUnknown\\\\n0-60 mph\\\\nUnknown\\\\nProduction Units\\\\nLimited to 12\\\\nHennessey Performance always puts 110% into its models, which is why we\\'re not surprised it\\'s unveiled a\\\\nmanual version of its incredible F5 Roadster\\\\n. The F5 is the first hypercar the brand has made fully in-house. There is no Lotus chassis used here, and it\\'s an unbelievable first attempt as it boasts over 1,800 horsepower courtesy of the most American of powertrains: a Twin-turbo V8.\\\\nRelated\\\\nMost Powerful Rear-Wheel Drive Car Ever With A Manual Transmission\\\\nSome of the most powerful cars ever made feature rapid-fire semi-automatic gearboxes, so this is the most powerful equipped with a manual unit.\\\\nPosts\\\\nBy\\\\nKyle Francis\\\\nDec 6, 2024\\\\nOf course, handling power like this is usually left to the likes of some robust and advanced automatic transmission, but the company was determined to get a manual involved. This meant reaching out to Costruzione Italiana Macchine Attrezzi (CIMA) for their expertise in such matters, a company that has extensive experience in such matters, given it\\'s also created a manual for the upcoming NILU hypercar. We can only imagine what a car like this would be to drive, and given only 12 will be made, we guess we\\'re stuck dreaming.\\\\n5\\\\nF80\\\\n$3,100,000\\\\nFeature\\\\nDetails\\\\nPowertrain\\\\nTwin-Turbo V6 Hybrid\\\\nHorsepower\\\\n1,184 hp\\\\nTorque\\\\n627 lb-ft (engine only)\\\\nTop Speed\\\\n217 mph\\\\n0-62 mph\\\\n2.15 seconds\\\\nProduction Units\\\\nLimited to 799\\\\nThe enigmatic La Ferrari successor has finally been\\\\nrevealed to the world as the F80 hypercar\\\\nready to help bring the Prancing Horse into the future. The speculation about this car has been never-ending since the first production mules were seen years ago. Having to stand on the shoulders of such a revered predecessor is no easy task, but if there\\'s one company capable of doing it, it\\'s Ferrari.\\\\nRelated\\\\nWATCH: Ferrari F80\\'s V6 Sounds Like Disappointment, Makes Us Long For A V12\\\\nFerrari has many reasons for downsizing from a V12, but we have one reason why it was a bad idea: the sound.\\\\nPosts\\\\nBy\\\\nJacob Oliva\\\\nOct 22, 2024\\\\nThe result certainly has the looks of a next-gen hypercar, invoking a boxier image and a distinct nose like the one on the\\\\n12Cilindri\\\\nthat gives it the impression of sucking to the ground. A 0-60 mph time of 2.15 seconds is also impressive, as is the 217 mph top speed, but there\\'s no denying the V6 powertrain lacks the visceral nature of the previously used V12, and we\\'re hoping the driving experience makes up for it.\\\\n4\\\\nPagani Utopia Roadster\\\\n$3,300,000\\\\nFeature\\\\nDetails\\\\nEngine\\\\nTwin-Turbo V12\\\\nHorsepower\\\\n851 hp\\\\nTorque\\\\n811 lb-ft\\\\nTop Speed\\\\nUnknown\\\\n0-60 mph\\\\nUnknown\\\\nProduction Units\\\\nLimited to 130\\\\nEvery vehicle Pagani Automobili creates is a work of art, as it\\'s a company in the business of creating art as much as it\\'s in the business of creating supercars, but the\\\\nnew Utopia Roadster is no exception\\\\n. First, it weighs a mere 2,822 lbs - the same as the coupe - thanks to extensive weight-saving techniques. If you want cover, you\\'ll either have to choose between a removable hardtop, or a soft top found in a suitcase in the middle of the car for emergencies.\\\\nIt features the same twin-turbo V12 as the regular\\\\nUtopia\\\\n, and its performance is the same as it produces a blistering 851 horses, but any mention of top speed or 0-60 mph times would be uncharacteristic of the company. At the very least, you can choose a manual or automatic transmission, and any number of other features with a starting price of $3.3 million.\\\\n3\\\\nPininfarina Battista and Barchetta \\\\\"Bruce Wayne\\\\\"\\\\n$4,200,000\\\\nFeature\\\\nDetails\\\\nPowertrain\\\\nQuad Electric Motors\\\\nHorsepower\\\\n1,877 hp\\\\nTorque\\\\n1,726 lb-ft\\\\nTop Speed\\\\n222 mph\\\\n0-60 mph\\\\n1.79 seconds\\\\nProduction Units\\\\nLimited to 4\\\\nThis is one of\\\\nthe most unique reveals of the year\\\\n, and it\\'s all thanks to Batman. Warner Brothers has had the grand idea of turning Batman\\'s fictional alter-ego, Billionaire Bruce Wayne, into the inspiration for real-life items and experiences, and it\\'s teamed up with Pininfarina to create 4 bespoke vehicles in honor of him. They\\'re based on the B95 hyper Barchetta and the\\\\nBattista\\\\nhyper GT, with all the incredible performance they pack.\\\\nThere is a coupe and convertible version of each, starting with the \\'Gotham\\' variant, which is meant to represent the sophistication of the civilian \\\\\"Bruce Wayne\\\\\". The other two are the \\\\\"Dark Knight\\\\\" versions, which are meant to represent the dark, brooding nature of Batman himself. All four models are incredibly unique and incredibly expensive, and we look forward to seeing similar vehicles in the future.\\\\n2\\\\nBugatti Tourbillon\\\\n$4,600,000\\\\nFeature\\\\nDetails\\\\nEngine\\\\nV16 Hybrid\\\\nHorsepower\\\\n1,775 hp\\\\nTorque\\\\n664 lb-ft (engine torque)\\\\nTop Speed\\\\n276 mph\\\\n0-62 mph\\\\n2.0 seconds\\\\nProduction Units\\\\nLimited to 250\\\\nThe\\\\nTourbillon\\\\nis the next masterpiece from Bugatti, and it\\'s the result of the profound electrification expertise owner Rimac was able to impart to the French brand. Rather than going full EV with the next-generation hypercar, the company decided that glorious combustion was an inseparable part of Bugatti\\'s identity, and thus coupled electric motors with an all-new V16 engine - the first production V16 in 80 years.\\\\nRelated\\\\nThe Bugatti Tourbillon\\'s V16 Sounds Spectacular\\\\nThis is the first time the Tourbillon\\'s V16 has been heard from outside, unfiltered.\\\\nPosts\\\\n3\\\\nBy\\\\nSebastian Cenizo\\\\nNov 25, 2024\\\\nAside from that, the car is leaner and meaner than the Chiron that preceded it, but Bugatti is adamant that it\\'s even more livable, and even usable as a daily driver if you\\'re crazy enough. While we couldn\\'t even dream of spending $4.6 million on a vehicle of any kind, sitting in the driver\\'s seat of the new Tourbillon and\\\\nstaring at its mesmerizing gauge cluster\\\\nmay just be worth the price of entry.\\\\n1\\\\nRolls-Royce Arcadia Droptail\\\\n~$31 Million\\\\nFeature\\\\nDetails\\\\nEngine\\\\nTwin-Turbo V12\\\\nHorsepower\\\\n593 hp\\\\nTorque\\\\n620 lb-ft\\\\nTop Speed\\\\nUnknown\\\\n0-60 mph\\\\nUnknown\\\\nProduction Units\\\\nLimited to 1\\\\nAnd the most expensive new car for 2024 is\\\\nthe Rolls-Royce Arcadia Droptail\\\\n, and it isn\\'t even close. Look, we know we said no one-offs, but how can you not include a $31 million vehicle? Before Rolls-Royce embarked on the Droptail journey there wasn\\'t anything even remotely this expensive for sale.\\\\nIt\\'s bathed in a \\\\\"timeless white\\\\\" color that is meant to look solid most of the time and complex under the lights thanks to aluminum and glass particles in the paint. 8,000 hours of woodwork make up the interior, and the clock face is the most complex ever fit to a Rolls-Royce. The watch face took two years alone to develop and five months to fit in place. Along with the innumerable other pieces of the car that were perfected and hand-placed, the unbelievable price tag is a little more understandable.

Flag temporal inconsistencies or conflicting sources.\\n- delta10: delta10: For date answers, output YYYYMMDD format (no hyphens) unless explicitly instructed otherwise; evaluation frameworks may normalize dates by removing delimiters.\\n- delta11: For ambiguous entity references ('the representative', 'the candidate'), enumerate all plausible matches before selecting one. Cross-verify against authoritative sources (official databases, government records) before finalizing.\\n- delta12: For complex nested queries, split into sequential focused searches. Execute all steps to completion; persist through partial results and retry with refined keywords before concluding inability to answer.\\n- delta13: delta13: For time-period-specific queries (Q1-Q3, first half, etc.), verify the exact period in fetched sources before inferring from full-year data. Don't assume annual leadership implies quarterly leadership.\\n- delta14: delta14: When fetched sources directly answer the query (e.g., 'Samsung led Q1-Q3 2024'), extract and trust that content over inferences. Flag if you pivot away from a fetched answer without explicit contradiction.\\n- delta15: For multi-step chains, verify each intermediate fact (identity, tenure, location, birthplace) against ≥2 independent sources before proceeding. Truncated fetches require explicit re-fetch or secondary source confirmation.\\n- delta16: delta16: For geographic/positional endpoints (mayors, officials), verify exact name format and current tenure against official government websites or databases, not just news sources. Flag if sources conflict on identity.\\n- delta17: delta17: For biographical data (birthplace, origin) from truncated fetches, re-fetch with expanded mode or search secondary authoritative sources (official bios, government records) before inferring downstream facts.\\n- delta18: For multi-step chains, inspect and extract data from each fetched result before concluding.

Since joining in 2022, he\\\\u2019s covered industry news, EV technology, and tuner culture, combining research and insight with a focus on overlooked and distinctive vehicles from every era.\\\\nSign in to your\\\\nCarBuzz\\\\naccount\\\\nfollow\\\\nFollow\\\\nfollowed\\\\nFollowed\\\\nLike\\\\nLike\\\\nThread\\\\nLog in\\\\nHere is a fact-based summary of the story contents:\\\\nTry something different:\\\\nShow me the facts\\\\nExplain it like I\\\\u2019m 5\\\\nGive me a lighthearted recap\\\\n2024 has been a big year for enthusiasts, as many of the world\\'s most renowned supercar and hypercar makers have released new, breathtaking models. For some, like Bentley and Aston Martin, these are extravagant low-volume cars that build on previous high-quality engineering, but others, like McLaren and Ferrari, announced new halo models that are set to redefine performance for the modern age.\\\\nAs one would expect, vehicles such as this don\\'t come cheap. These are the best models from the most coveted automakers on the planet and, as such, they cost more money than most can even imagine. While there\\'s been no shortage of reveals this year, we wanted to take a look at the 10 most expensive vehicles revealed this year. All of them cost upwards of $2 million, but the most expensive vehicle on the list claims the crown by a mile.\\\\nWe aimed to only include vehicles on this list with a production run, no one-offs (except for one notable exception), and only one model per manufacturer. They\\'ve been ordered from least to most expensive, and we\\'ve only included models with confirmed or approximate pricing.\\\\n10\\\\nMcLaren W1\\\\n$2,100,000\\\\nFeature\\\\nDetails\\\\nPowertrain\\\\n4.0-liter Twin-Turbo V8 Hybrid\\\\nHorsepower\\\\n1,258 hp\\\\nTorque\\\\n988 lb-ft\\\\nTop Speed\\\\n217 mph\\\\n0-60 mph\\\\n2.7 seconds\\\\nProduction Units\\\\nLimited to 399 units\\\\nIt\\'s been a long time since production of the P1 ended, and McLaren has finally remedied this halo-car dry spell with its successor: the W1. The name comes from the brand\\'s \\\\\"World Championship\\\\\" mindset and is a tribute to the company\\'s first Driver\\'s and Constructor\\'s World Championships in 1974, the latter of which the brand nabbed once again in 2024.\\\\nGoogle News\\\\nFollow On\\\\nGoogle News\\\\nAdd CarBuzz to your Google News feed.\\\\nExpand\\\\nCollapse\\\\nObviously, there\\'s a lot of weight to this name, but the car lives up to it thanks to\\\\nsome truly impressive performance specs\\\\n. A twin-turbo V8 hybrid powertrain boasts over 1,200 horsepower, making it the most powerful road-legal McLaren ever made. It combines that performance with a McLaren Aerocell monocoque and F1-derived suspension, allowing for a dry weight of a mere 3,084 lbs. The top speed is 217, and the car looks like a gorgeous evolution of the brand\\'s famous design language. It\\'s everything we wanted out of the next-gen McLaren hypercar,\\\\n9\\\\nBertone GB110\\\\n$2,100,000\\\\nFeature\\\\nDetails\\\\nEngine\\\\nV8\\\\nHorsepower\\\\n1,108 hp\\\\nTorque\\\\n811 lb-ft\\\\nTop Speed\\\\n217 mph\\\\n0-186 mph\\\\n12.9 seconds\\\\nProduction Units\\\\nLimited to 33\\\\nIn a long-awaited return of the legendary design house, Bertone has unveiled the GB100: a wedge masterpiece that will become\\\\nthe design house\\'s first hypercar\\\\n. Powered by a twin-turbo 5.2-liter V10 engine, it will produce over 1,100 horsepower and rocket to 217 mph, according to the design studio. The company isn\\'t worried about 0-60 mph times, instead going much bigger, and saying it\\'ll shoot from 0-186 mph in just 12.9 seconds.\\\\nThe design is incredible, a mix\\\\nbetween the 1950s and the 1970s\\\\n, and pays homage to recent supercars from Lamborghini and McLaren. The company even says it will be the first hypercar to run off fuel made of plastic waste, but we\\'ll have to see if that happens when the first of the 33-car production run makes it into customer\\'s hands.\\\\n8\\\\nBentley Batur Convertible\\\\n~$2,300,000\\\\nFeature\\\\nDetails\\\\nEngine\\\\nTwin-Turbo W12\\\\nHorsepower\\\\n739 hp\\\\nTorque\\\\n737 lb-ft\\\\nTop Speed\\\\n209 mph\\\\n0-60 mph\\\\n3.3 seconds\\\\nProduction Units\\\\nLimited to 16\\\\nIt still hurts to think that Bentley\\'s incredible W12 has finally been laid to rest. As one of the most incredible powerplants on sale for the past two decades, this unique configuration could be found under the hood of nearly every Bentley, and the Bentley Batur Convertible is its sendoff. As the name suggests, it\\'s the convertible version of the\\\\nBatur\\\\nCoupe that was unveiled in 2022, and it\\'s every bit as\\\\nbeautiful with the top up or down\\\\n.\\\\nRelated\\\\nHow Bentley\\'s Outgoing W12 Compares With Its New Plug-In Hybrid V8 Engine\\\\nWith the production of the W12 engine over, how does the twelve-cylinder icon compare to its PHEV V* replacement?\\\\nPosts\\\\n1\\\\nBy\\\\nRyan De Villiers\\\\nAug 2, 2024\\\\nIt features the most powerful version of the W12 ever made thanks to things like upgraded turbochargers and intercoolers, and here it produces a healthy 739 horsepower, allowing it to rocket to 209 mph. Of course, very few will likely get their cars up to this speed, as they\\'ll much rather enjoy the bespoke comfort and attention they\\'ll get driving slowly through the crowds at places like Pebble Beach or Monaco instead.\\\\n7\\\\nAston Martin Valiant\\\\n$2,500,000\\\\nFeature\\\\nDetails\\\\nEngine\\\\nTwin-Turbo V12\\\\nHorsepower\\\\n734 hp\\\\nTorque\\\\n555 lb-ft\\\\nTop Speed\\\\nUnknown\\\\n0-60 mph\\\\nUnknown\\\\nProduction Units\\\\nLimited to 38\\\\nAston Martin has been enjoying releasing highly limited runs of supercars over the last few years, all building off of one another. The newest entrant to this list is the\\\\nValiant\\\\n, which is an evolution of the\\\\nValour\\\\nbased on a bespoke commission created by F1 World Champion Fernando Alonso. It looks properly mean, with an exaggerated body kit and massive wing that make it look ready for takeoff.\\\\nOf course, another iteration of the brand\\'s incredible V12 is under the hood, and here it\\'s mated to a six-speed manual transmission with some of the most beautiful exposed linkages. The brand hasn\\'t announced any performance numbers, so we have no idea how quickly it will rocket around a racetrack, but it will likely only see use in such a fashion very rarely,\\\\ngiven that only 38 will be produced\\\\nfor the exorbitant price of $2.5 million.\\\\n6\\\\nHennessey Venom F5-M Roadster\\\\n$2,650,000\\\\nFeature\\\\nDetails\\\\nEngine\\\\nTwin-Turbo V8\\\\nHorsepower\\\\n1,817 hp\\\\nTorque\\\\n1,193 lb-ft\\\\nTop Speed\\\\nUnknown\\\\n0-60 mph\\\\nUnknown\\\\nProduction Units\\\\nLimited to 12\\\\nHennessey Performance always puts 110% into its models, which is why we\\'re not surprised it\\'s unveiled a\\\\nmanual version of its incredible F5 Roadster\\\\n. The F5 is the first hypercar the brand has made fully in-house. There is no Lotus chassis used here, and it\\'s an unbelievable first attempt as it boasts over 1,800 horsepower courtesy of the most American of powertrains: a Twin-turbo V8.\\\\nRelated\\\\nMost Powerful Rear-Wheel Drive Car Ever With A Manual Transmission\\\\nSome of the most powerful cars ever made feature rapid-fire semi-automatic gearboxes, so this is the most powerful equipped with a manual unit.\\\\nPosts\\\\nBy\\\\nKyle Francis\\\\nDec 6, 2024\\\\nOf course, handling power like this is usually left to the likes of some robust and advanced automatic transmission, but the company was determined to get a manual involved. This meant reaching out to Costruzione Italiana Macchine Attrezzi (CIMA) for their expertise in such matters, a company that has extensive experience in such matters, given it\\'s also created a manual for the upcoming NILU hypercar. We can only imagine what a car like this would be to drive, and given only 12 will be made, we guess we\\'re stuck dreaming.\\\\n5\\\\nF80\\\\n$3,100,000\\\\nFeature\\\\nDetails\\\\nPowertrain\\\\nTwin-Turbo V6 Hybrid\\\\nHorsepower\\\\n1,184 hp\\\\nTorque\\\\n627 lb-ft (engine only)\\\\nTop Speed\\\\n217 mph\\\\n0-62 mph\\\\n2.15 seconds\\\\nProduction Units\\\\nLimited to 799\\\\nThe enigmatic La Ferrari successor has finally been\\\\nrevealed to the world as the F80 hypercar\\\\nready to help bring the Prancing Horse into the future. The speculation about this car has been never-ending since the first production mules were seen years ago. Having to stand on the shoulders of such a revered predecessor is no easy task, but if there\\'s one company capable of doing it, it\\'s Ferrari.\\\\nRelated\\\\nWATCH: Ferrari F80\\'s V6 Sounds Like Disappointment, Makes Us Long For A V12\\\\nFerrari has many reasons for downsizing from a V12, but we have one reason why it was a bad idea: the sound.\\\\nPosts\\\\nBy\\\\nJacob Oliva\\\\nOct 22, 2024\\\\nThe result certainly has the looks of a next-gen hypercar, invoking a boxier image and a distinct nose like the one on the\\\\n12Cilindri\\\\nthat gives it the impression of sucking to the ground. A 0-60 mph time of 2.15 seconds is also impressive, as is the 217 mph top speed, but there\\'s no denying the V6 powertrain lacks the visceral nature of the previously used V12, and we\\'re hoping the driving experience makes up for it.\\\\n4\\\\nPagani Utopia Roadster\\\\n$3,300,000\\\\nFeature\\\\nDetails\\\\nEngine\\\\nTwin-Turbo V12\\\\nHorsepower\\\\n851 hp\\\\nTorque\\\\n811 lb-ft\\\\nTop Speed\\\\nUnknown\\\\n0-60 mph\\\\nUnknown\\\\nProduction Units\\\\nLimited to 130\\\\nEvery vehicle Pagani Automobili creates is a work of art, as it\\'s a company in the business of creating art as much as it\\'s in the business of creating supercars, but the\\\\nnew Utopia Roadster is no exception\\\\n. First, it weighs a mere 2,822 lbs - the same as the coupe - thanks to extensive weight-saving techniques. If you want cover, you\\'ll either have to choose between a removable hardtop, or a soft top found in a suitcase in the middle of the car for emergencies.\\\\nIt features the same twin-turbo V12 as the regular\\\\nUtopia\\\\n, and its performance is the same as it produces a blistering 851 horses, but any mention of top speed or 0-60 mph times would be uncharacteristic of the company. At the very least, you can choose a manual or automatic transmission, and any number of other features with a starting price of $3.3 million.\\\\n3\\\\nPininfarina Battista and Barchetta \\\\\"Bruce Wayne\\\\\"\\\\n$4,200,000\\\\nFeature\\\\nDetails\\\\nPowertrain\\\\nQuad Electric Motors\\\\nHorsepower\\\\n1,877 hp\\\\nTorque\\\\n1,726 lb-ft\\\\nTop Speed\\\\n222 mph\\\\n0-60 mph\\\\n1.79 seconds\\\\nProduction Units\\\\nLimited to 4\\\\nThis is one of\\\\nthe most unique reveals of the year\\\\n, and it\\'s all thanks to Batman. Warner Brothers has had the grand idea of turning Batman\\'s fictional alter-ego, Billionaire Bruce Wayne, into the inspiration for real-life items and experiences, and it\\'s teamed up with Pininfarina to create 4 bespoke vehicles in honor of him. They\\'re based on the B95 hyper Barchetta and the\\\\nBattista\\\\nhyper GT, with all the incredible performance they pack.\\\\nThere is a coupe and convertible version of each, starting with the \\'Gotham\\' variant, which is meant to represent the sophistication of the civilian \\\\\"Bruce Wayne\\\\\". The other two are the \\\\\"Dark Knight\\\\\" versions, which are meant to represent the dark, brooding nature of Batman himself. All four models are incredibly unique and incredibly expensive, and we look forward to seeing similar vehicles in the future.\\\\n2\\\\nBugatti Tourbillon\\\\n$4,600,000\\\\nFeature\\\\nDetails\\\\nEngine\\\\nV16 Hybrid\\\\nHorsepower\\\\n1,775 hp\\\\nTorque\\\\n664 lb-ft (engine torque)\\\\nTop Speed\\\\n276 mph\\\\n0-62 mph\\\\n2.0 seconds\\\\nProduction Units\\\\nLimited to 250\\\\nThe\\\\nTourbillon\\\\nis the next masterpiece from Bugatti, and it\\'s the result of the profound electrification expertise owner Rimac was able to impart to the French brand. Rather than going full EV with the next-generation hypercar, the company decided that glorious combustion was an inseparable part of Bugatti\\'s identity, and thus coupled electric motors with an all-new V16 engine - the first production V16 in 80 years.\\\\nRelated\\\\nThe Bugatti Tourbillon\\'s V16 Sounds Spectacular\\\\nThis is the first time the Tourbillon\\'s V16 has been heard from outside, unfiltered.\\\\nPosts\\\\n3\\\\nBy\\\\nSebastian Cenizo\\\\nNov 25, 2024\\\\nAside from that, the car is leaner and meaner than the Chiron that preceded it, but Bugatti is adamant that it\\'s even more livable, and even usable as a daily driver if you\\'re crazy enough. While we couldn\\'t even dream of spending $4.6 million on a vehicle of any kind, sitting in the driver\\'s seat of the new Tourbillon and\\\\nstaring at its mesmerizing gauge cluster\\\\nmay just be worth the price of entry.\\\\n1\\\\nRolls-Royce Arcadia Droptail\\\\n~$31 Million\\\\nFeature\\\\nDetails\\\\nEngine\\\\nTwin-Turbo V12\\\\nHorsepower\\\\n593 hp\\\\nTorque\\\\n620 lb-ft\\\\nTop Speed\\\\nUnknown\\\\n0-60 mph\\\\nUnknown\\\\nProduction Units\\\\nLimited to 1\\\\nAnd the most expensive new car for 2024 is\\\\nthe Rolls-Royce Arcadia Droptail\\\\n, and it isn\\'t even close. Look, we know we said no one-offs, but how can you not include a $31 million vehicle? Before Rolls-Royce embarked on the Droptail journey there wasn\\'t anything even remotely this expensive for sale.\\\\nIt\\'s bathed in a \\\\\"timeless white\\\\\" color that is meant to look solid most of the time and complex under the lights thanks to aluminum and glass particles in the paint. 8,000 hours of woodwork make up the interior, and the clock face is the most complex ever fit to a Rolls-Royce. The watch face took two years alone to develop and five months to fit in place. Along with the innumerable other pieces of the car that were perfected and hand-placed, the unbelievable price tag is a little more understandable.
